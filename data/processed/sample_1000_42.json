Williams and made such communication of your wishes as I thought most likely to be attended with success. You know his ambitious cast, and that he thinks he could be more serviceable at the head of a great department than collector of a district. I mentioned the death of the comptroller, and the probability inmy opinionthat the President from the knowlege he had of the present auditors habits experience and capacities for business would fix upon him for a successor; in which case the auditorship which was a very important office would become vacant. I observed on the advantages of a residence at the seat of Congress if he still inclined to mount higher, that he knew your power and disposition, and said I would take upon myself to make the necessary suggestions. The idea of the auditors office being a step to a still more desirable one had its weight, but he finally declined, alledging his ill state of health, and the recent death of a brother in law Col. Stull which has devolved upon him the care of his children and estate. In short he was not to be induced to be auditor, tho’ I thought could I have said comptrouller he might, notwithstanding his present state of health would unfit him for discharging the duties of either.\nI then called on Mr. Wm. Smith who with less shew of talentswill make a much better auditor. He will have as little to learn as the General; is as systematic, a more correct and perfect accountant, of great respectability and of longer standing in society. I found also here that the comptrollership was a more darling object. My first conversation was yesterday, and it was not till about half an hour ago I got him to consent to use my discretion, so you may use yours. I was obliged to intimate, that from the opinion you had of him, I could entertain no doubt but his appointment would be certain unless the President got entangled to the Southward.\nYou judged right. Nay, should even what I once thought of take place, and my present temper of mind continue, I would remain where I am. My mind in the loss of a brother has received a severe shock. My wife like yours is every thing that is kind good and excellent, and was there only one man more in the world I should be the happiest man in it.\nAdieu and believe me yours most sincerely and most affectionately\nJames McHenry"

Why? You must hear and judge me. I now study the law, and will within two months, after a seven month’s stay at this University, be able to correct many faults and to add many important points in my letter. This reason alone would do, I think, but, dear Sir, I have an other one not less valuable. In former times, my letter as it now lies before me, would give your friend some pleasure, and by this way to myself likewise. But now, among dangerous civil dissensions, this very letter cannot be too cautiously written, not with a mind to hide truth in equivocal terms, I think too freely, in spite of any persecution, for concealing my real sentiments, but I want to express my mind with so much perspicuity and so concisely that it cannot be misconstrued. For you ought to know, my respectable friend, that though a friend to liberty, my principles do not agree with many who call themselves by the same denomination. I am writing a Dissertation De ratione Subsidii fœderatis debiti, and take the freedom to desire your answering without any delay the following Queries.\nWhich are at present the general interests of the United States?\nWhat is the extent of the Congress’s power in managing them?\nWhich are the expences of Congress?\nWhich the revenues.\nIn which way do the particular states contribute to the general expences?\nAre general duties, to be levied by Congress, still expected to be acquiesced to by the States?\nBut if besides this you should know any thing relative to the matter I treat, be so kind as to add it to your answers.\nYour Notes on Virginia have been read by a few men of understanding who got both instruction and amusement by the lecture.\nHow does your health, my dear Sir, and when will both your time and your inclination allow you a turn through Holland; forif you don’t come very soon to me, you’ll oblige me to set out for Paris in order to see you.\nI embrace you very heartily.

Altho Since the 27th of december, no letter has reached us from him. We have in compliance with his request, prepared the Children to meet you.\nI need not Say, how painfull there seperation from me will be. Age, infirmities, and many recent afflictions, which I have met, in the Death of many near and dear Friends, and relatives, have broken me down, and give me little reason, to boast myself of tomorrow, as I know not, what a day may bring forth, So that when they go from me it is with the painfull Idea; that I shall see their faces no more, may we all finally meet in a better world.\nThe Sudden death, of my dear and only Sister the last week; has opened every wound affresh, and caused my tears to flow anew—George and Susan, are now gone to Atkinson, to pay the last tribute of Respect, to her remains.\nShe went to Bed on Saturday night well except a Slight Soar throat, which she complaind of, having read two sermons in the evening’s about 12 oclock she awoke, complaind that She was chill’d and oppresst upon her lungs. Mr Peabody rose, call’d up a Maid Servant. Abbe also got up, sent for the doctor, Who soon came, but found the spirit had taken Wing, Without the knowledge or least suspicion of her attendents.\nSo tranquil was her exit; so few her sufferings, a translation from this earthly abode, to the mansions of glorified Spirits, her whole Life was one continued Series of usefull Services. and her circle was rendered extensive by the many youths, of both Sexes, committed to her care, She always considerd her charge, to extend beyond, food, and raiment, to their minds, to their manners, and to their Morals. Many, very Many Youths, have cause to embalm her memory in their hearts, and to hold her in gratefull remembrance. To her Family—I cannot estimate her loss. her Husbands Heart Safely trusted in her, for she had done him good, all the days of her Life. she was his pride, his glory, and his crown.\nTo me, She was most dear, and now I am left alone; the Sole Surviving branch from the parent Stock.\nI had flatterd myself, with the hope that my Son, with his Family, are convened together in his Native Country, would have once more blessed my Eyes. I now despair of it, and the only consolation remaining to me, for his continuence abroad, is his having changed climates, and comeing so much nearer to me, that I may hear frequently from him, and from you, who I hope will feel yourself invigorated by the Air of your Native soil. and meeting with your sons, So long absent from you, in a period of their Lives, When they have almost grown out of your knowledge—George’s growth has been so rapid, that it has given him a Rusticity; which he feels—he Scarcly knows what to do with himself. but his mind is a Casket, which contains jewels, that only want culling, refineing, and burnishing, in his Fathers Crucible to render them bright—John is quick at comprehension, <ardent> ardent in pursuit: may be drawn to what you please, but liable to be cast away, without watchfull attention. I trust they have not imbibed any bad habits—\nI have not been profuse with their cloathing, Broadcloth has been so very high in price, up to 15 dollars pr yd, that I have had only one suit a peice for them, tho the peace reduced the price to 9 or 10 dollars pr yd, it is still out of reason. they have ordinary cloth for their Sea trip. I had them made a day new shirts, flannels & draws &c every thing which I conceived would be wanting, untill they Should reach you, and mr Perkins has promised to supply any wants they may have, untill they can meet their Father.\nMr Everett the Brother of Alexander is a passenger with them, and a mr Ticknor, a Young Gentleman held in high estimation by our literary Gentleman—\nI have Sent to your Friends at Washington, and they have forwarded Letters for you, which I commit to the care of the Children. I did not know when mr Boyd went, or I Should not have omitted So good an opportunity of writing.\nLouisa & Susan desire to be affectionatly remembered to you, write to me my dear Daughter, and tell me all your adventures. I long to hear of your safe arrival with that of our dear Charles, either in Paris or England—which would cheer the Heart of your / affectionate and afflicted / Mother\nAbigail Adams."

Elsworth & Murray will be called to Paris again for that purpose.\nYou had been previously apprised that the proceedings of France with respect to this country had produced a sensible alienation from them in the people of this country. that these proceedings were artfully & industriously laid hold of here & played off in a thousand forms & with multiplied exaggerations to induce the people to consent to a war with France, & consequently then an alliance with England, and a disposition to approach ours more nearly to the forms of that government. the XYZ. mission wrought us up to a perfect frenzy. every principle of civil caution was lost sight of, and the Charlatans drove headlong as madness & wickedness prompted. but they were not able to keep up the bubble. some states had remained firm in their senses, and some portions of every state. the paroxysm with those who had gone into the delusion began to subside. in this state were things at the date ofmy last letter, wherein I stated to you the change which was working. it has kept pace fully with the expectations therein hinted. we have with us at this time a great majority, & the residue rallying so fast to their old principles that we have reason to believe all traces of the late party divisions will be obliterated; except that the leadersof the war party had committed themselves too far to change. but they will be without followers & therefore may be neglected. in this transition the New England states are slowest because under the dominion of their priests who had begun to hope they could toll us on to an established church to be in union with the state. even there however they are getting to rights and the probable election ofGerryby the republican interest will be the signal of it’s ascendancy in Massachusets. these are the outlines only. I refer you to mr Dawson for the particulars, he being fully possessed of them. they will be well worth your minute enquiry, as they will give you some idea of our present character & pursuits, which are so different from what they were when you left this country, that no two nations are more unlike. he can particularly give you the true state of the late election which cannot be at all understood abroad. no endeavors will be spared on my part to reunite the nation in harmony and in interest.\nYour letters of Aug. 6: & Sep. 18. has been duly recieved: as were also the volumes of the Connoissance des tems for 1800. 1. 2. 3. except the additional part of 1800. which you expressed a hope of obtaining, and will be acceptable, as will the continuation of the work as fast as it appears. I am now here for a few days only, to set in motion some pressing measures which would not admit delay. I shall then go home for 3. or 4. weeks to make some arrangements there, necessary on my removal, and then become fixed here. as soon after my return as the first press of business will permit, I will resume the subject of your affairs here, and give you a statement in continuation of my last. in the mean time mr Barnes will have given you detached views from time to time. I now inclose a letter from him. Brown has paid up, & mr Jefferson of Richmond is in hopes shortly to get Moseby’s money. Barnes is worthy of your entire confidence for his uprightness and his caution & safety. you had better join him in a regular power of attorney with me, for fear of my death.—I shall this summer send through you to mrPougensa commission for some books, placing previously funds in Amsterdam to draw on, & I shall probably trouble yourself with some commissions. present me respectfully toour common friend, & accept yourself assurances of my constant & sincere affection.\nTh: Jefferson\nP.S. Just as I was about to seal my letter, mr Pichon arrives and puts into my handyours of Dec. 9.—I must ask the favor of you to find a safe conveyance for the inclosed letter."

The only Question remaining with me is what I shall do with myself? Something I must do orEnnui will rain upon me, in Bucketts. A Frenchman would Say Ennui pleuvra a grosses gouttes. Will Books and Farms answer the End? I must go out on a morning and evening and fodder my Cattle, I believe, and take a Walk every noon to Pennshill—Pother in my garden among the fruit Trees and Cucumbers, and plant a Potatoe Yard with my own hand.— If I had money enough to Spend upon my farms I might find Employment enough. But what shall I do for that? Shall I go to the Bar again? I have forgotten all my Law and lost my organs of Speech, and besides that have given my books away. If I had them, I might possibly educate a young Gentleman or two, for the Profession.\nAs to the farms, Burrell may continue. But French’s farm shall lie common rather than be treated as it has been.— Belchers farm I will keep in my own hands possitively, that is the Land. French’s House shall be let, seperately to a Number of Tenants unless We can get one good one to give a sufficient Rent. Belchers House, with the rest of French’s Land, may be let with the Barns on shares or for a Rent. And whoever has it shall be confined to plant but four Acres of Corn and one of Potatoes.

I fear there may be some difficulty in filling the chasm in the Roll’s office. Having occasion several years ago for a sight of the Journals for a particular period, and being desirous at the same time of replacing the lost part of my set, I was led to make enquiries in every promising direction, but without success. The only copies I ever obtained, were two from Kentucky, preserved by delegates from that country when a part of Virginia; neither of which happened to be what I wanted, or is of a date named in your letter. I wish that even a public invitation thro’ the press may enable the Executive to give compleat effect to the provisions of the law. May I be permitted to suggest, should the resort be found necessary, that the Library of Congress, which now contains that of Mr. Jefferson, may deserve the attention of the Executive.

While they governed it, there were constant wars between the white & the red people. to such a height was the hatred of both parties carried that they thought it no crime to kill one another in Cold blood whenever they had an opportunity. this Spirit led many of the Indians to take side against us in the war; and at the close of it the English made peace for themselves, and left the Indians to get out of it as well as they could. it was not till 12 years after that we were able by the treaty of Greenville to close our wars with all our red neighbors. from that moment, My Children, the policy of this country towards you has been entirely changed. Genl. Washington our first President began a line of just and friendly conduct towards you. Mr. Adams the Second, continued it, and from the moment I came into the administration I have looked upon you with the same good will as my own fellow Citizens, have considered your interests as our interests, and peace and friendship as a blessing to us all seeing with sincere regret that your people were wasting away, believing that this proceeded from your frequent wars and the destructive use of Spirituous liquors, and scanty supplies of food. I have inculcated peace with all your neighbors, have endeavored to prevent the introduction of Spirituous liquors among you, and have pressed on you to rely for food on the culture of the earth more than on hunting. On the contrary, My Children, the English persuade you to hunt, they supply you with Spirituous liquors, and are now endeavoring to engage you to join them in the war against us should a war take place. you possess reason My Children, as we do, and you will judge for your selves which of us advise you as friends. the course they advise has worn you down to your present numbers, but temperance, peace & agriculture will raise you up to be what your forefathers were, will prepare you to possess property, to wish to live under regular laws, to join us in our government to mix with us in Society, and your blood & ours united will spread again over this great Island.\nMy Children, this is the last time I shall Speak to you as your Father, it is the last counsel I have to give. I am now too old to watch over the extensive concerns of the seventeen states and their territories. I have therefore requested my fellow Citizens to permit me to retire to live with my family and to Chuse another Chief and another father for you. and in a short time I shall retire and resign into his hands the care of your & our concerns. be assured My Children that he will have the same friendly disposition towards you which I have had, and that you will find in him a true & affectionate Father. entertain therefore no uneasiness on account of this change, for there will be no change as to you. indeed My Children, this is now the disposition towards you of all our people. they look upon you as brethren, born in the Same land, & having the same interests. in your journey to this place you have seen many of them. I am certain they have received you as brothers, and been ready to Shew you every kindness. you will see the same on the road by which you will return; and were you to pass from North to South, or east to west in any part of the United States you would find yourselves always among friends. tell this therefore to your people on your return home, assure them that no change will ever take place in our dispositions towards them; deliver to them my adieux and my prayers to the great Spirit for their happiness. tell them that during my administration I have held their hands fast in Mine that I will put it into the hand of their new Father, who will hold it as I have done.\nTh:Jefferson"

I wish it was in my power to acquaint you that the time was fixed, and that we had taken our passage for our return to dear Virginia. Since you left us I thought proper (seeing the affairs of Mr. Paradise grow worse, and worse every day, as my truly good friend Dr. Bancroft will acquaint you) to write a letter to Dr. Price to beg he would use his influence with him, to go, and take my daughter and myself with him. Mr. Paradise promised Dr. Price, and Dr. Bancroft that he would go by the 15th. of July, and if he could not support his family in his absence, he would take them likewise. He has a debt of above Two thousand pounds and as yet no Ship is arrived, and I fear his Creditors begin to be a little uneasy about their money. Mr. Seward a friend of Mr. Paradises offered to pay the Sum of Two hundred pound and above to one of his Creditors if he would go directly, and take his family with him. He has refused him, and seems determined to stay in England at all events. I have ever since I was married been begging Mr. Paradise to carry me home, and he from time to time have put me off. Was he a man that had Ten Thousand a Year, he ought to have granted my request, as it was neither unreasonable nor unjust. But in the Situation he is at present, without a farthing in this part of the world to support him, or his family, I think, I have a right to demand that if he will not go himself and take his family with him, he ought to let me go, and to have the whole management of my property. I wish your Excellency would give me your opinion upon this Subject. I forgot to tell you, that he had only his life Interest in the Estate, as likewise, the Interes of the money in the Funds of England. I must beg of your Excellency to write to me by the first opportunity. I am in great affliction as Dr. Bancroft will tell you. He has received the letters for which act of friendship, I return your Excellency my most sincere thanks. Adieu Dear Sir And believe me to be your Excellencys most obliged humble Servant and friend,\nL.Paradise\nP.S.

    "content": "[19 May 1829]\nSUPREME COURT\nOn the opening of the Supreme Court yesterday morning, Mr.David B. Ogden rose and said he would take the liberty to announce to the Court the death ofJohn Jay.It was not his intention to pronounce the eulogy of the deceased. The Court and all who heard him well knew the splendid services which he had rendered to his country. He was a member of the Convention who formed the Constitution of this State at the organization of the government; he was the first Chief Justice of this Court, under that Constitution, and discharged the duties of the office with fidelity and ability, until sent abroad by the Government of the United States, to secure and protect its interests in Europe. On his return, he received the appointment of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, and continued in that office until elected Governor of this State; and in every station that he occupied, he felt himself authorized to say that more talent, more zeal, more patriotism, and greater purity had never been exhibited by a pubic functionary than by John Jay. As a tribute of respect to his memory, he moved that the Court do adjourn.\nMr.D. S. Jones said he rose to second the motion. He was prompted to do so not only by his feelings of respect for the public character of the deceased, which demanded all that had been said, but by his veneration for is private character; whilst living, he had felt towards him the strongest attachment, having for many years been a member of his family and witnessed his domestic virtues, and the purity of his private life.\nChief Justice Savage observed it was due to the memory of John Jay, that this respect should be paid—and directed the Court to adjourn until tomorrow.\nAt a meeting of the Bar of the State of New-York, now attending the Supreme Court, in the room occupied by the Justices of the Superior Court, in the City Hall of the City of New York, the 19thday of May, 1829.\nThe Supreme Court on being informed of the death of the venerable John Jay, immediately adjourned for the day. It was agreed by the gentlemen present, that they immediately form themselves into a meeting for the purpose of expressing their sentiments on this melancholy occasion.\nOn motion of D. S. Jones, Esq. seconded by Gen. Tallmadge, D. B. Ogden, Esq. was called to the chair, and the like motion John Sudam, Esq. was appointed Secretary.\nThe purpose of the meeting having been stated by D. S. Jones, Esq.— on his motion it was resolved that a committee of six be appointed by the Chairman, to draft such resolutions, as should seem to them suitable to the occasion; and that they report to this meeting at this place, this day at 5 o’clock, P. M.\nThe Chairman nominated, Greene D. Bronson, Attorney General, James Tallmadge, J. A. Spencer, D. S. Jones, G. Griffin, and J. I. Roosevelt, to this committee.\nOn the motion of Gen. Tallmadge, seconded by D. S. Jones, Esq. it was resolved, that the Chairman and Secretary communicate to the Judges of the Superior Court, and Court of Common Pleas, the death of Mr. Jay—that the Justices of the Supreme Court had, on its being communicated to them, adjourned for the day, and the proceedings of this meeting, and that this meeting stand adjourned until 5 o’clock, P. M. at the same place, where the gentlemen of the Bar are respectfully requested to attend.\nThe meeting then adjourned until 5 o’clock this day.\nD. B. OGDEN, Chairman.\nJOHN SUDAM, Secretary\nCity Hall, New York,Tuesday, May19, 1829, FiveO’clock, P. M.\nThe Bar of the State of New-York, now attending the sitting of the Supreme Court, met pursuant to their adjournment.\nD. B. OGDEN, Chairman.\nJohn Sudam, Secretary.\nJames Tallmadge, Esq., Chairman of the Committee appointed this morning, reported the following Preamble and Resolutions, which were unanimously adopted.\nThe Committee respectfully report:—\nThat the recent decease of the late venerable JOHN JAY is the cause of deep grief, and the present engrossing subject of private and public feeling.\nJohn Jay was a native of our State, and a member of this Bar. The events of the American Revolution called him early into public life. His inherent love of political and religious liberty, made him an early and active agent in laying the foundations of this nation; of which he soon became one of the firmest, and continued one of its fairest pillars. In 1777, he was appointed the first Chief Justice of this state, under the constitution which he had eminently contributed to frame, and most of which was drafted by his pen. He was a member of the first Congress of the United States, and bore a conspicuouspart in all its important duties, and presided for some time over the deliberations of that body. The exigencies of this nation required and commanded his great talents, discretion, firmness and skill, in various interesting and important duties during the Revolutionary struggle. At times, as Chairman of the Committee of Public Safety, he secured the domestic tranquility, and at other times he was employed in important foreign missions and diplomatic trusts. He bore a prominent part in the negotiations for our Independence as a nation, and the ultimate treaty of peace. He continued to represent his country at foreign courts for a number of years. He was, shortly after his return, called to preside as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, which place he afterwards left to accept the Executive Chair of the State of New York. When he had performed that last and highest duty to his native State, he declined all further judicial or political employment, and retired to the calm shade of domestic retreat, where the evening of his days was spent in social and benevolent intercourse, and in the signal observance of that religion which had been the bright beam of the morning and the evening of his life; the rights and toleration of which he had secured to this people, in one of the most important articles of our Constitution.\nThere is no place more fit, and no persons are more willing to express their sincere feelings on this occasion, than this Bar, where the talents and acquirements of the deceased were so early and so often displayed. Therefore,\nResolved,That the members of this Bar are impressed with deep grief upon the decease of their illustrious brother, John Jay. They find, however, a consolation in the reflection that his conduct through a long and useful life, has given a lustre to our profession, and to this Bar; and that while his character for private virtues and public worth has justly endeared him to the nation, his patriotism, his great talents as a statesman, and his great acquirements as a jurist—his eminent piety as a Christian, and probity as a man, all unite to present him to the public as an example whose radiance points to the attainment of excellence.\nResolved, That in respect for the character of the deceased, the members of this Bar will wear crape during the period of thirty days.\nResolved, That the Chairman and Secretary are desired to transmit a copy of the proceedings of this meeting to the family of the deceased.\nResolved, That the proceedings be signed by the Chairman and Secretary, and published in the different newspapers of this city.\nD. B. OGDEN, Chairman\nJohn Sudam, Secretary"

Pinckney availed himself of that credit at first but then began to draw on Drouilhet & Company and wished, as the chief partner of Joyes & Sons had died, to draw on other firms. “We replied that the House continued and that … He would there meet with every regard due his rank and personal merits.” Pinckney wished them to deposit credit with Kavara & Sons. This was done to the amount of Pinckney’s salary and that of his secretary, and the credit with Joyes was annulled. Pinckney “has expressed the greatest dissatisfaction” at this act “and wished to have credits opened both with Joyes & Kavara.” They have done this, leaving the credit for salary with Kavara and opening one for contingent expenses and consular payments with Joyes. “We only mention this circumstance to you … that you might be informed of the case.”"

Adams and Mr. Gerry.\nResolved that a Committee of five be appointed to prepare and bring in a Plan of a military Accademy at the Army: The Members chosen Mr. Hooper, Mr. Lynch, Mr. Wythe, Mr. Williams and Mr. J. Adams.\nOn this same day, I wrote to Colonel Knox in these Words. “This day I had the honour of making a motion for the Appointment of a Committee to consider of a Plan for the Establishment of a military Accademy, in the Army. The Committee was appointed and your Servant was one. Write me your Sentiments upon the Subject.”\nAs this was, in my Opinion the most critical and dangerous Period of the whole revolutionary War, as all that I had seen and heard and read of the State of our Army made a great impression[upon]my Mind, and arroused the most allarming Apprehension, I will conceal nothing from Posterity. My own private Letters, to confidential Friends, will shew my Opinion at the time of the State of facts, and the measures that were necessary, to retrieve our disgraces. Like Mr. Gifford, I look back, with a sort of Scepticism, on the Application of those days and cannot account for the possibility of finding time amidst all my Employments in Congress and the Board of War, to write and copy the Letters I find in my Books. I had no Secretary or Clerk and all appears in my hand Writing. I wrote to Colonel Tudor\nPhiladelphia September 26. 1776\nDr. Sir\nYour obliging favours of September 6 from New York and that of the 23d from the Plains of Haarlem, are now before me. The Picture you draw of the Army, and the disorders which prevail in it, is shock­ing: but I believe it is just. But We often find, that in the variagated Scaene of human life, that much good grows out of great Evil.... A few disgraces and defeats have done more, towards convincing the Congress, than the Rhetorick of many months, assisted by frequent Letters from the General, and many other Officers of the Army, was able to effect. Before this time you have been informed, that the Articles of War, are passed and printed, and a new Plan for the formation of a permanent and regular Army, is adopted. I wish it may have Success.—Pray give me your Opinion of it.\nThe late Events at New York have almost overcome my Utmost Patience. I can bear the Conflagration of Towns, nay almost any thing else, public or private, better than disgrace. The Cowardice of New England men is an unexpected discovery to me, and I confess has put my Philosophy to the Tryal. If I had heard, that Parsons’s and Fellows’s Brigades had been cutt to Pieces, and had my Father, my Brother and Son been among the Slain, I sincerely believe, upon a cool examination of my own heart, it would not have given me so much grief as the shamefull flight of the 15th. instant.... I hope that God will forgive the guilty in the next World: but, should any question concerning this transaction, come into any place where I have a Vote, I should think it my duty to be inexorable, in this. We have none of the particulars, but I conclude, that such detestable Behaviour of whole Brigades, could not have happened, without the worst Examples, in some Officers of Rank.—These, if any such there are, shall never want my Voice, for sending them to another World. If the best Friend I have, should prove to be one of them, I should think myself guilty of his Crime, and that I deserved his Punishment, if I interposed one Word, between him and death.\nI lament the Fall of the young Hero, Henly. But I wish you had been more particular, in your narration of the Enterprize, which proved so glorious and so fatal to him. You are much mistaken in your Apprehension, that We are minutely informed of such Events. We suffer great Anxiety, and the Public suffers many Misfortunes, for Want of Information. The Post Office, which has been in fault, is now beginning to do its duty. Dont you neglect yours.\nColonel Tudor.\nAnother Letter to Colonel Tudor, without a date, but about the same time.\nMy young Friend.\nI pity the Situation of the General, because it is a difficult, a dangerous and a most important one. I make it my Rule to cover all Imperfections in the Generals, and other Officers of inferiour rank as well as I can, and to make full and ample Allowances for all their Virtues, Merits, and Services.\nI recollect that Polybius, who was as great a Judge of War as any of his Age, was loud in his Praises of the Roman Troops. He never imputed any defeat, to the fault of the men, but, universally to the folly and incapacity, of their Commanders. Our Generals and other Officers must learn the same Justice and Policy. General imputations of Cowardice and impatience of discipline to the Men, are false, or, if true, it is the fault of the Officers: it is owing to their ignorance, incapacity or indolence: and farther, if it was true, concealing is the Way to cure it, not publishing of it. The frequent Surprizes, by which our Officers and Men are taken, in the most palpable trapps, convince me, that there is a dearth of Genius among them.\nThere never was perhaps, a Crisis, in which a Coincidence of Circumstances, offered a fairer Opportunity for some great mind, to shew and exert itself.\nAnd perhaps there is not in all Antiquity, if there is in universal History, an Example, more apposite to our Situation, than that of Thebes, or a Character more deserving of imitation, than that of Epaminondas.\nThe Boeotians were remarkable, even to a proverb, for their dullness, and untill the Age of Epaminondas, made no figure in War. By the Peace of Antalcidas, the honor and interest of Greece, was prostituted to the Pride of Sparta. The Thebans were compelled to acceed to that Treaty, although it deprived them of the dominion of Boeotia, and the Spartans by tampering with a perfidious Aristocratick faction at last got possession of their citadel, and reduced the Thebans to unconditional Subjugation. From this wretched State both of foreign and domestic Slavery, they were delivered, by the Virtue and Ability of Epaminondas, and raised to power superiour to the other Grecian States. The honest Citizens, enraged to see their Country, thus cheated into Servitude, determined to set her free. The project was well laid, and boldly executed by Pelopidas, who entered the City with a small number of resolute men in disguise, destroyed Leontidas and Archias,the two Traytors and Tyrants, and with the assistance of Epaminondas and his friends, together with a body of Athenians, regained the Citadel. The Spartans hearing of this revolution, entered the territories of the Thebans with a powerful Army, to take vengeance of the Rebells, and reduce the City to its former Subjection. The timorous Athenians, dreading the formidable Power of Sparta, renounced all Friendship for the Thebans, and punished with great Severity, such of their Citizens as favoured them. The Thebans, destitute of Friends, and deserted by their Allies, appeared to the rest of the World to be devoted to inevitable destruction. In such a desperate conjuncture of Affairs, the Genius and Virtue of two great Men shone forth to the Astonishment of all Mankind.\nBut what means did they Use?... Their Men were raw Militia, fresh recruits, new raised Citizens and husbandmen, unexperienced, undisciplined, unused to Subordination, having been born and educated under the most democratical government in all Greece, and, what is worse, from a natural or habitual hebetude, not very adroit, at learning any Thing.\nThey began by training their Men, inspiring them with a Contempt and hatred of Servitude, and the noble resolution of dying in defence of the Liberty and glory of their Country. They judged it rash, to hazard a decisive battle, with their new raised Militia, against the best troops in Greece: but chose rather to harrass the Spartans, with frequent Skirmishes, to instruct their men in military discipline and the manoeuvres of War. The minds of their Soldiers were thus animated with the desire of glory, and their Bodies hardened to the fatigues of War, whilst they gained Experience, Confidence and Courage by daily Rencounters.\nThese great Generals, like all others in similar Circumstances, never engaging presumptuously, but carefully watching for favourable Opportunities, let loose the Thebans, like young hounds upon their Ennemies, and rendered them alert and brave, by tasting the Sweets of Victory. By bringing them off, in Safety, they made them fond of the Sport and eager after the most dangerous Enterprizes. By this skilfull Conduct, they brought their forces, to defeat the Spartans at Platea, Thespia, Tenagra and Tegyra. These Actions were only preludes to the decisive Battle of Leuctra: for, flushed with these Successes, the Thebans dreaded no Enemy, however superior in number. Greece saw with Astonishment, the Spartans defeated by inferiour numbers of Men, who had always been held in Contempt. This train of Successes elated the Thebans, but only enraged the Spartans. They negotiateda Peace with Athens and all the other Grecian States, and Thebes was devoted to Spartan revenge. The largest Army, they ever sent into the field entered Boeotia, but Epaminondas, with six thousand Men only, by his admirable disposition of them and their bravery, engaged and defeated three times their number, and soon afterwards marched to the Gates of Sparta, and exhibited to that haughty People a Sight they had never before beheld.\nColl. Tudor.\nPhiladelphia September 29. 1776\nDear Sir\nThis Evening I had the Pleasure of your’s, of the 25th.... I have only to ask you, whether it would be agreable to you, to have Austin made your Lieutenant Colonel? Let me know sincerely, for I will never propose it without your Approbation.\nI agree with you that there is nothing of the vast, in the Characters of the Ennemy’s General or Admiral.... But I differ in Opinion from you, when you think, that if there had been, they would have Annihilated your Army.... It is very true, that a silly Panick has been spread in your Army and from thence even to Philadelphia. But Hannibal spread as great a Panick, once, at Rome, without daring to take Advantage of it.... If he had, his own Army would have been annihilated: and he knew it. A Panick in an Army when pushed to desperation, becomes Heroism.\nHowever, I despize that Panick and those who have been infected with it, and I could almost consent that the good old Roman fashion of decimation should be introduced. The Legion, which ran away, had the name of every Man in it, put into a Box, and then drawn out, and every tenth Man was put to death. The terror of this Uncertainty, whose Lot it would be to die, restrained the whole in the time of danger from indulging their fears.\nPray tell me, Colonel Knox, does every Man to the Southward of Hudsons River, behave like an Hero, and every Man to the Northward of it, like a Poltroon, or not? The Rumours, Reports and Letters which come here upon every Occasion, represent the New England Troops, as Cowards, running away perpetually, and the Southern Troops as standing bravely. I wish I could know, whether it is true. I want to know for the Government of my own Conduct, because, if the New Englandmen are a Pack of Cowards, I would resign my place in Congress, where I should not choose to represent Poltroons, and re­move to some Southern Colony, where I could enjoy the Society of Heros, and have a chance of learning some time or other, to be part of an Hero myself.... I must say, that your Amiable General gives too much Occasion for these reports by his Letters, in which he often mentions things to the disadvantage of some part of New England, but seldom any thing of the Kind about any other Part of the Continent.\nYou complain of the popular Plan of raising the new Army. But if you make the plan as unpopular, as you please, you will not mend the matter. If you leave the Appointment of Officers to the General, or to the Congress, it will not be so well done, as if left to the Assemblies. The true cause of the Want of good Officers in the Army is not, because the Appointment is left to the Assemblies, but because such officers in sufficient Numbers are not in America. Without materials the best Workmen can do nothing. Time, Study and Experience alone, must make a sufficient number of able Officers.\nI wish We had a military Accademy, and should be obliged to you for a Plan of such an Institution. The Expence would be a trifle, no object at all, with me.\nPhiladelphia October 1. 1776 Tuesday\nDear Sir\nYours of September the 9th. was duely received. The measure of a Standing Army, is at length resolved on. You have seen the plan. How do you like it? I wish it was liable to fewer Exceptions, but We must be content to crawl into the right Way, by degrees. This was the best that We could obtain, at present.\nI am extreamly sorry, to learn, that the Troops have been disheartened. But this despondency of Spirit, was the natural Effect, of the Retreats you have made, one after another. When the Men saw your General Officers, taken in a trap, upon Long Island, and the Army obliged to abandon that important Post, in consequence of thatAmbuscade, and the City of New York, evacuated in Consequence of the Retreat from Long Island, the firmest Army in the World, would have been seized, in similar Circumstances, with more or less of a Panick. But your men will now recover their Spirits in a short time.\nThere is a Way, of introducing Discipline into the most irregular Army, and of inspiring Courage into the most pusillanimous Collection of Men.\nYour Army, Sir, give me leave to say, has been ill managed in two most essential points. The first is, in neglecting to train your Regiments and Brigades to the manual Exercises and the Manoeuvres. Nothing inspires the Men with military pride and Ambition (for even the Men must have Ambition) like calling them together every day, and making them appear as well as they can. By living much together, and moving in concert, they acquire a confidence in themselves, and in each other. By being exposed to the Inspection, and Observations of each other, they become ambitious of appearing as clean and neat as they can, which as well as the Exercise preserves their health and hardens their Bodies against diseases. But instead of these martial, manly and elegant Exercises, they have been kept constantly at Work in digging Trenches in the Earth; which keeps them constantly dirty, and not having Wives, Mothers, Sisters or Daughters, as they used to have at home to take care of them and keep them clean, they gradually loose their Perspiration and their health.\nAnother particular, which is absolutely necessary to introduce military Ardour into a new raised Army, has been totally neglected. Such an Army should be governed with caution and circumspection, I agree. It should act chiefly upon the defensive, and no decisive Battle should be hazarded. But still an enterprizing Spirit should be encouraged. Favourable Opportunities should be watched, and Parties should be ordered out upon little excursions and expeditions: and in this manner Officers and Men should be permitted to acquire fame and honor in the Army, which will soon give them a real fondness for fighting. They will love the Sport. But instead of this, every Spark of an enterprizing Spirit in the Army, seems to have been carefully extinguished.\nOur inevitable destruction will be the Consequence, if these faults are not amended. I rejoiced to hear of the Attempt, upon Montresors Island: but am vexed and mortified, at its shameful Issue. I am more humiliated still to learn, that the Enterprize was not renewed. If there had been Officers or Men, who would have undertaken the Expedition, a second, a third or a fiftieth time, I would have had that Island, ifit had cost me, half my Army. Pray inform me what Officers and Men were sent upon that Attempt. It is said, there was shameful Cowardice. If any Officer was guilty of it, I sincerely hope he will be punished with death. This most infamous and detestable Crime, must never be forgiven in an Officer. Punishments as well as rewards will be necessary to Government, as long as fear, as well as hope, is a natural Passion in the human Breast.\nColonel Hitchcock.\nPhiladelphia October 2. 1776. Wednesday\nMy dear Sir\nYour Letter from Long Island of the 29th. of August, has not been answered. I was very much obliged to You, for it: because it contained Intelligence of a transaction, about which, We were left very much in the dark, at that time, and indeed to this hour, are not so well informed as We should be. I think, Sir, that the Enemy, by landing upon that Island, put it compleatly in our Power to have broke their plans, for this Campaign, and to have defended New York. But there are strong Marks of Negligence, Indolence, Presumption, and Incapacity on our Side, by which scandalous Attributes We lost that Island wholly, and Manhattan Island nearly. I am happy to hear your Behaviour commended. But, Sir, it is manifest that our Officers were not acquainted with the Ground; that they had never reconnoitred the Enemy; that they had neither Spies, Sentries, nor Guards placed as they ought to have been; and that they had been shamefully remiss in Obtaining Intelligence, of the Numbers and Motions of the Enemy, as well as of the nature of the Ground.\nI have read, somewhere or other that a Commander, who is surprized in the night, though guilty of an egregious fault, may yet plead something in Excuse: but, in point of discipline, for a General to be surprized by an Enemy, just under his nose, in open day and caught in a State of wanton Security, from an overweening presumption in his own Strength, is a crime of so capital a nature, as to admit of neither Alleviation nor Pardon. Ancient Generals have been nailed to Gibbets alive, for such crimes.\nBe this as it may, I think the Enemy have reached their Ne plus, for this Year. I have drawn this Conclusion from the Example of Hannibal, whose Conquests changed the face and fortune of the War. According to Montesquieu, so long as he kept his whole Army together, he always defeated the Romans: but when he was obliged to put Garrisons into Cities, to defend his Allies, to besiege Strong holds, or prevent their being besieged, he then found himself too weak, and lost a great part of his Army by piece meal. Conquests are easily made, because We atchieve them with our whole force: they are retained with difficulty because We defend them, with only a part of our forces.\nHowe, with his whole Army could easily take Possession of Staten Island, where there was nothing to oppose him. With the same Army, he found no great difficulty, in getting Long Island, where evenhisTalent at Strategem, which is very far from Eminent, was superiour to the Capacity of his Antagonist. After this it was easy to take New York which was wisely abandoned to him. But, Sir, the Case is altered. A Garrison is left at Staten Island, another at Long Island, a little one at Montresor’s Island, another at Paulus Hook, a large Body in the City of New York and a larger still to man the Lines, across the Island, between the Seventh and the Eighth mile Stone. After such a division and distribution of his forces, I think he has nearly reached the End of histetherfor this Year.\nThe Ennemies Forces are now in a Situation peculiarly happy, for Us to take Advantage of.... If an enterprizing Spirit should be indulged and encouraged, by our Commanders, in little Expeditions to Staten Island, Long Island, Montresors Island and elsewhere, you would gradually form your Soldiers for great Exploits and you would weaken, harrass and dispirit your Enemy.\nThus you see I scribble my Opinions with great Assurance, upon Subjects, which I understand not. If they are right, it is well, if wrong they will not mislead you.\nGeneral Parsons.\nIf these Papers should hereafter be read by disinterested Persons, they will perhaps think that I took too much upon me, in assuming the Office of Preceptor to the Army. To this Objection I can only reply, by asserting that it was high time, that the Army had some Instructor, or other. It was a Scaene of Indiscipline, Insubordination and Confusion. Colonel Tudor had been my Pupil, as a Clerk in my Office as a Barrister at Law. Colonel Knox had been a Youth, whohad attracted my notice by his pleasing manners and inquisitive turn of Mind, when I was a Man in Business in Boston. General Parsons had been my junior for three Years at Colledge, and upon terms of familiarity. I had therefore no reason to suppose that either of them would take offence, at any thing I should write. Again I had formed an Opinion, that Courage and reading were all that were necessary to the formation of an Officer. Of the Courage of these Gentlemen and the Officers in general I had no doubt. But I was too well informed, that most of the Officers were deficient in reading: and I wished to turn the Minds of such as were capable of it, to that great Source of Information. I had met with an Observation among regular Officers, that Mankind were naturally divided into three Sorts. One third of them are animated at the first appearance of danger, and will press forward to meet it and examine it; another third are allarmed at it: but will neither advance nor retreat, till they know the nature of it: but stand to meet it: the remaining third will run or fly upon the first thought of it. If this Remark is just, as I believed it was, it appeared to me that the only Way to form an Army to be confided in, was a systematic discipline: by which means all Men may be made Heroes. In this manner, in time our American Army was made equal to the Veterans of France and England: and in this Way the Armies of France have been made invincible hitherto: and in the same Way, they will be ultimately conquered or at least successfully resisted by their Ennemies.\nAll the Powers of Government, Legislative, Executive and judiciary, were at that time collected in one Centre and that Centre was the Congress. As a Member of that Body I had contributed my Share towards the Creation of the Army, and the Appointment of all the Officers: and as President of the Board of War it was my peculiar Province to superintend every thing relating to the Army. I will add without Vanity, I had read as much on the military Art and much more of the History of War than any American Officer of that Army, General Lee excepted. If all these Considerations are not a sufficient Apology, for my Interference, I submit to censure. Certain it is, that these Letters and many more that I wrote, without preserving Copies, were not callculated to procure me popularity in the Army: but on the contrary contributed to produce those misrepresentations which were diffused from that Source against me as well my Friend Samuel Adams and others. The Generals Secretaries and Aids, all from the Southward, Reed, Harrison &c. &c. were young Gentlemen of Letters, and thought full as highly of themselves as they ought to think, andmuch more disrespectfully of New England and even of Congress, than they ought to have thought, dictated Letters, which were not well calculated to preserve the Subordination of the military Power, to the civil Authority, which the Spirit of Liberty will always require and enforce. Of Hamilton, when he came into the Generals Family I need say nothing. For my Part I never heard of him till after the Peace, and the Evacuation of the City of New York. The World has heard enough of him since. His Petulance, Impertinence and Impudence, will make too great a figure in these memoires hereafter."

If this should be the case, & they still entertain hopes of conquest in America may they not call on us, if they should, we were never less prepared, some demon or other certainly possessed us when we disposed of the ships that were prepared to bring over the arms & ammunition from France, both which are now so much wanted that if you do not think it improper you will do your Country a great Service by again pressing the Chevilier to use his Interest to have them brought over in a Frigate. The Scarcity of musket powder is so great in the State owing to our losses by the Enemy, and the necessary consumption of it during the Invasion that an immediate supply is absolutely necessary, and as we have no means of obtaining it but thro’ Congress I request that you use your Endeavours to procure from them three or four Tuns, that they owe us so much is beyond a doubt, but if you can not obtain it in return for what we have expended, rather than be disappointed I would take it on account till our demands can be adjusted. If you succeed please to send it on immediately in Waggons to Westham, which you know is not above six Miles from hence and is not much out of the way, the waggonage shall be certainly paid on their arrival. If you can’t procure it this way, perhaps it may be bought in the Town for Tobacco on Rappahannock or Powtamac rivers, to be paid on the delivery of the Powder, in which case you’l please to contract for it, and inform me immediately. the price we have fixed you have below, but if that can not be obtained, I know of no other Mode of doing Justice to the State & the Seller but by having it fixed by the agent for commutables here & a Merchant of reputation oneither of those rivers chosen by the Seller.

    "content": "[19 Jan. 1803]\nSir\nI avail myself of that acquaintance which it is my happiness to enjoy to address to you a letter on the application which has been made to you through the agency of my friends. A sentiment of delicacy induced me in the first instance to be silent; but maturer, I hope more just reflections have determined me to explain to you my motives in requesting the post of Secretary in the mission which the folly of foreign nations has rendered necessary. If I considered this as a post of profit I should feel degraded by the conduct which I have pursued: I shudder at the suspicion that my political character could be influenced by hopes of personal emolument. It is unnecessary I flattermyself to call to your recollection that my principles were avowed in the most explicit language, at a period when Republicanism offered to its votarys as a reward only the danger of Martyrdom. In a pecuniary point of view this appointment would be probably injurious; for it will abstract me from a profession which gives to Industry and Integrity ample remuneration for the exertions it compels; And whatever the salary may be, although I should not imitate the philosopher who impatient of delay threw away his treasure in thedesert, I beleive my accumulated riches would very little retard my progress homeward. A visit to Europe has long been the object of my fondest desire, of my most anxious solicitude. An opportunity of examining the governments of the old World, of witnessing the manners of its Inhabitants & of tracing more accurately the causes which have checked theirmoralimprovement appears to me calculated to energize and adorn any mind; and I will not deny that an infantine desire of amusement, of viewing their architecture, their paintings and their sculpture may have given the acmé to a passion which I feel in every pulsation of my frame. No moment of my life could be more favourable to the indulgence of this wish than the present. I have within a few months obtained a licence to practise law; but not having hitherto attended any court, I am free from ingagements which might retard my departure. Should my return from Europe be immediate, I could resume the profession I abandon; if prolonged, I have the prospect of a patrimonial estate which insures to me an honorable independence. Prompted by those considerations, I induced those gentlemen who have communicated my wishes to you, to request for me an appointment which will enable me to view European Society in its most polished form. An application has also been made to Mr Monroe, as I have understood it is customary to consult the wishes of the minister. The personal intercourse which has passed between Mr Monroe & myself has been but slight; It is not impossible that unfavourable impressions may be entertained by him towards me; if they are not removed by the inform[ation]which I hope it is in your power to afford, and to[. . .]which those gentlemen whom I am proud to call my friends have given to my pretensions, I shall have cause to regret that the calumnies with which my enemies have assailed me should have found their way to the breast of one who ought to know from his own experience, that the Voice of Federalism is not the Oracle of Truth. I have conveyed my sentiments not in the formal language I should assume to a stranger, but in that candid and plain manner, which an acquaintance is supposed to justify. Ihave only to observe that the rejection of this application can excite but feeble emotions, compared with those which swell within my breast at the recollection of those favours which I received at the most critical moment of my life.\nLewisHarvie"

And whereas it is expedient that such Courts should be speedily erected; and it is reasonable that the same mode of trial should be adopted for offenders of this kind on the high Seas as is used for offenders of the like sort upon the land.\nBe it therefore Ordained, and it is hereby ordained by the United States of America in Congress assembled and by the authority of the same, that all and every person and persons, who heretofore have committed, or who hereafter shall commit any piracy or felony upon the high Seas, or who shall be charged as accessories to the same either before or after the fact, may and shall be enquired of tried and Judged by grand and petit Juries according to the course of the common law, in like manner as if the piracy or felony were committed upon the land and within some County, district, or precinct in one of these United States; and the Justices of the Supreme or Superior Courts of Judicature, and Judge of the Court of Admiralty of the several and respective States or any two or more of them, are hereby constituted and appointed Judges for hearing and trying such offenders.\nAnd be it further ordained, that if any person or persons shall be indicted for any piracy or felony done or hereafter to be done upon the high seas, or as accessories before or after the fact, either on the land or upon the seas, by a grand jury for any County district or precinct within any of these United States, before the Justices of the Supreme or Superior Court and Judge of the Admiralty, or any two of them, that then such order, process, Judgment and execution shall be used had done and made, to and against every such person and persons so being indicted as against robbers murderers or other felons for robbery, murder or other felony, done upon the land within such county district or precinct as by the laws of the said State is accustomed: and the trial of such offence or offences, if it be denied by the offender or offenders, shall be had by twelve lawful men of the said County, District or Precinct and such as shall be convicted of any such offence or offences, by verdict, confession or otherwise in the said Court, shall have and suffer such pains of death losses of lands, goods and chattels or other punishment and by the same authority, as if they had been convicted and attainted of any robbery felony or other the said offences done upon the land and shall be utterly excluded the benefit of Clergy, where the same is taken away or not admitted for such like offences committed within the body of a County or on land where such trial shall be had.\nAnd be it further Ordained, that if there shall be more than one judge of the Admiralty in any of the United States, that then and in such case the Supreme executive power of such State, may and shall commissionate one of them exclusively to join in performing the duties required by this ordinance.\nAnd, be it further Ordained, that all losses and forfeitures of lands, goods and chattels incurred upon any such conviction and attainder shall go and belong to the State in which the said conviction and attainder shall be had.\nDone by the United States in Congress assembled the fifth day ofApril in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty one and in the fifth year of our independence."

    "content": "War Department April 21. 1794\nSir\nI have the honor to transmit you an estimate of the quantity and quality of Timber, Plank, Scantling and Copper &c. which will be required for each of the four largest frigates contemplated by the Act entitled “An Act to provide a naval armament” nearly the same quantity will also be wanted for each of the thirty six gunships mentioned in the said Act.\nIt has been decided by the President of the United States that the said frigates be built in the following ports, to wit\nIt appears to be of indispensible necessity that immediate arrangements should be made to obtain the articles contained in the estimate and to have them transported to the ports before mentioned—excepting such articles of the timber as may be obtained at, or in the neighbourhood of, the said places.\nThe live oak and red cedar must principally be obtained from the islands on the coast of Georgia. Some parts however may be obtained in North Carolina, although it is alledged that the farther South the live oak the better.\nDifferent opinions are entertained as to the most certain, and the most oeconomical mode of obtaining the live oak and cedar from Georgia, and transporting the same to the ports where the ships are to be built.\nSome persons recommend that one or more persons in whom due confidence may be placed, should repair to the Islands of Georgia, and contract with the proprietors of the timber as it stands for such parts as will serve the moulds, and that a sufficient number of axemen with their provision be sent from the northward, in order to cut the same, and transport it to the places where it is to be used. These persons assert that any contract made in Georgia or other parts to the Southward, will be executed by negroes, whose indolence and carelessness will inevitably produce disappointment or loss.\nThe moulds for the timbers of both sized ships are preparing and nearly finished. These must be transported to the places where the timber is to be cut, otherwise mistakes would arise and disappointment of course ensue.\nBesides the mode before mentioned, there are persons who recommend a contract with some persons, if such could be found, which is said to be the case to procure the timber in Georgia, and transport it to the respective ports or places.\nYou will please to judge which of these two modes will be preferable. I have understood that in 1776 or 1777 the frames of two 74 gun Ships were cut under the authority of the United States, part at Sunbury and part at a place called Kilkenny near the mouth of Savannah River, and that as the said timber was very large part of it yet remains. It may therefore be proper to look it up, and if it should answer for the frames of the proposed frigates as probable it would be excellent from its long seasoning.\nI have the honor to submit to you a letter from Mr Wereat of Georgia upon this subject, the purport of which is confirmed by Brigadier General Gunn of the same state.\nThe manner in which these vessels ought to be built has been under consideration, that is whether the hull and other parts susceptible of the measure should be built by a contract, or by a capable agent or agents appointed for the purpose of procuring the labor and materials. Upon enquiry however it appears improbable that a contract could be formed with the Shipbuilders in this place for the one directed to be built here. They alledge that if a contract was offered and accepted by two or more it would excite the ill will and envy of those who had no part in it, and as the frigate would require many hands the price of that sort of labor would rise, and that therefore it would be in the power of those not employed to raise the wages of the Journeymen a shilling or two per day, which would occasion great embarrassment, if not ruin, to the undertakers. Hence it would appear to follow as a consequence that if the Shipbuilders of Philadelphia, some of whom have considerable capitals, would decline a contract, that it would be almost or quite impracticable to obtain the building by contract elsewhere. If this should be so, then Agents respectable for their intelligence, activity, and integrity must be sought in the places in which the said frigates are directed to be built.\nThe President of the United States has approved of the said vessels being built under the directions of some agent or agents which I presume it will be in your department to nominate to him.\nI suppose however if you should find it practicable to build them by contract, that the subject will still be reconsidered by him, and as for myself I should find great satisfaction in a contract, if one, upon solid principles, could be obtained."

    "content": "[post August 4, 1802]\nIt has been often Said, and as often as denied, that there are Men in this Country attached to Democracy. Simple Democracy: to a Government in every State, of a Single Assembly of Representatives, without a Senate and without a Governor; to a Government of the Nation in a Congress of Delegates in one House without a Senate and without a President. The Charge is Supported by the Declarations of Numbers from Chase’s Rebellion and the Votes of County Conventions, down to the Letter to Mazzei <present time> to the Efforts in the House of Representatives to Sett aside the Treaty with England, and many other Actions and declarations of Individuals to this day. Whether the Writer of the Remarks is capable of comprehending it or not, there is a distinction between an Attachment to Monarchy, and an opinion that it will in Some Nations and at certain periods prevail, and that no human Wisdom or Virtue in Existence can prevent it.—Cato was never Suspected of any Attachment to Monarchy.—His Death was a full proof of two points. 1. that he detested and dreaded Monarchy more than death. 2. that he was fully convinced, that Monarchy in the person of Cæsar, could not be prevented in Rome. Men’s Opinions are not always conformable to their Wishes. Some have Understandings, as well as affections.\nAbstract Opinions in favour of Monarchy or Democracy may exist without Injury to the State. Plato & Aristotle declare freely in their Writings a Veneration for Kingly Goverment. Yet, in the most democratical Governments of Greece, they were not persecuted. An End will be put to all Liberty of thought as well as Speech, if Duane, Callender, Lyon, Cooper, Cheetham Wood, in Short all the Dogs of the Mob, are to be let loose upon every Man, who dares to Speculate upon Principles or Systems of Government. The Change of the last Administration, was in a very Small degree affected by any Sentiment that there were Men in the government whose Views were Subversive of Republicanism: because the very Men, who endeavoured to propagate Such a Sentiment <were> did not believe themselves and were not credited by others. Many of these Men were known to be more inclined to monarchical opinions, then those whom they accused. Many of these Men were known to have often declared their opinions, that the Constitution of the United States was defective, because it had not an hereditary President and an hereditary Senate. Others had been known to declare that no form of Government was worth any thing, but that of King Lords and Commons. Some had even Said that We ought to have a Monarchy in this Country in the Person of one of the Princes of England. This kind of Speeches and Opinions have been oftener uttered by those who are called Republicans and are now poss[e]ssed of Power in the States, than by Federalists. The Change of Administration in this Country was effected by the Federalists themselves: not by any change in favour of Republicanism in the People. <But this is a Subject I would not wish to devellop at present,> nor by any opinion that the new President was more of a Republican than the <old> former one. But this is a Subject that may be develloped hereafter.\nAre our Court Gazettes then prepared to Say that \"Liberty has vanished from France\" That the first Consul is an Usurper. That \"the French Nation have Submitted every political Right to the mercy of the Sword\" That \"The Republic is Subverted and Monarchy has returned“? This Language is <not likely> as remote from any tendency to preserve the Friendship between this Country and France, as it is from the Truth. The Government of France is at least as Republican, now as it ever has been Since the death of the King, or Since the Subversion of the Monarchy, or indeed Since the meeting of the Assembly of Notables in 1786.—It answers the Ends of Government in preserving personal Liberty, private property, and the Peace, order Tranquility and Happiness of Society, better than any republican Constitution that nation ever has enjoyed, and as well as any it will probably ever have. This mighty transformation has been effected without Violence or Conterition, by the Voice, of the People, by the general Sense, and the public opinions. The People of France are weary of blood, disgusted with murder, and indignant at Rapine. They have Seen and felt, and are at length convinced with an Unamimity, that is very remarkable, that Democracy, without controul, would depopulate And desolate France. They have Stopped in their career of Enthusiasm and delirium and are restored in Some measure to their right minds.\nWhat connection there is between the returning reason of the french People and the publication of these Letters, it is not easy to imagine. These Letters are calculated, in every Sentence and every Word of them, to preserve the Constitution of the United States, from deviating into Monarchy on one hand, and Democracy on the other. If the Ballance of our Government was destroyed and the Weights all placed in the democratical Scale, nothing is more certain than that all the Confusions and horrors of France for fifteen or Sixteen Years past must be our Lot, and nothing could relieve Us from them but a Civil War, or a victorious Army: unless the People Should Suddenly recover their Reason and restore the Equilibrium of the Government. These letters were written twelve years ago, from an Apprehension that the contagion of a french delerium, might Seize the Passions of the American People and excite them to destroy their present Constitution, anni[hi]late the President’s Office, the Senate of the United States, <the independe> the Governors and Senates of the individual States, and the independent Judiciaries in all of them.\nThe publication of these Letters is another affair. They had been long forgotten and would probably have never been again read or Seen by the Writer, had he not been informed, that last Winter, certain Persons in Boston were handing <about one of> them about, Shewing sentences or half sentences and misrepresenting them not only in democratical Clubbs but to Lawye[r]s and Judges during their Terms. This Information alone, occasioned Some old Letter Books to be Searched and these Copies to be published. They contain no sentiments which the Writer ever concealed. He held them in 1776 when his Letter to Mr Wythe was published. He held them openly and publicly in 1779, when in the Convention which formed the Constitution of the State of Massachusetts. They run through the three Volumes of his Defence of the Constitutions of the United States and have been frankly professed and avowed in public and private on all occasions for Six and Twenty Years. a greater falshood cannot be committed to Writing, than is contained in these Words \"Hitherto they have courted the Obscurity of a rigid concealment.\""

You are therefore in concert with Genl Lacey to fix upon a certain time and attempt to disable all the Mills upon Pennepack, Frankfort and Wissahicken Creeks, beginning Morrises at Frankfort, Vanderens on Wissahicken and Lewis’s at Pennepack and proceed as far as the people usually come out for Flour. As it will be impossible for you to remove the stones, I am advised to take off the spindles and saw off the spikes of the water wheels This you will therefore do as soon as possible, the whole must be began upon the same time, that you may have proceeded some distance before the enemy can get notice. You must be fully sensible of the necessity of secrecy, and therefore none should be intrusted but the Officers who are to execute the Business, and those should be such who have no connections in the part of the Country where the Mills are. Nothing will convince the Markett people that we are in earnest till an example is made of one of them, and I therefore desire you will use your endeavours to apprehend some notorious offender against whom there will be proof and send him here for Trial, seize all the provision and the horses & Carriages drove by women & Boys, many of whom are employed as they think indulgence will be allowed on Account of Sex and Age.

    "content": "[c.20 June 1792]\nThe period which will close the appointment with which my fellow citizens have honoured me, being not very distant, and the time actually arrived, at which their thoughts must be designating the citizen who is to administer the Executive Government of the United States during the ensuing term, it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I should apprize such of my fellow citizens as may retain their partialitytowards me, that I am not to be numbered among those out of whom a choice is to be made.\nI beg them to be assured that the Resolution which dictates this intimation has not been taken without the strictest regard to the relation which as a dutiful citizen I bear to my country; and that in withdrawing that tender of my service, which silence in my situation might imply, I am not influenced by the smallest deficiency of zeal for its future interests, or of grateful respect for its past kindness; but by the fullest persuasion that such a step is compatible with both.\nThe impressions under which I entered on the present arduous trust were explained on the proper occasion. In discharge of this trust I can only say that I have contributed towards the organization and administration of the Government the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. For any errors which may have flowed from this source, I feel all the regret which an anxiety for the public good can excite; not without the double consolation, however, arising from a consciousness of their being involuntary, and an experience of the candor which will interpret them. If there were any circumstances that could give value to my inferior qualifications for the trust, these circumstances must have been temporary. In this light was the undertaking viewed when I ventured on it. Being, moreover still farther advanced into the decline of life, I am every day more sensible that the increasing weight of years, renders the private walks of it in the shade of retirement, as necessary as they will be acceptable to me. May I be allowed to add, that it will be among the highest as well as purest enjoyments that can sweeten the remnant of my days, to partake, in a private station in the midst of my fellow citizens, of that benign influence of good laws under a free Government, which has been the ultimate object of all our wishes, and in which I confide as the happy reward of our cares and labours. May I be allowed farther to add, as a consideration far more important, that an early example of rotation in an office of so high and delicate a nature, may equally accord with the republican spirit of our constitution, and the ideas of liberty and safety entertained by the people.\n(If a farewell address is to be added at the expiration of the term, the following paragraph may conclude the present).\nUnder these circumstances a return to my private station according to the purpose with which I quitted it, is the part which duty as well as inclination assigns me. In executing it I shall carry with me every tender recollection which gratitude to my fellow citizens can awaken; and a sensibility to the permanent happiness of my Country, which will render it the object of my unceasing vows and most fervent supplications.\n(Should no further address be intended, the preceding paragraph being omitted, the present address may go on as follows).\nIn contemplating the moment at which the curtain is to drop for ever on the public scenes of my life, my sensations anticipate and do not permit me to suspend, the deep acknowledgments required by that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country for the many honors it has conferred on me, for the distinguished confidence it has reposed in me, and for the opportunities I have thus enjoyed of testifying my inviolable attachment by the most steadfast services which my faculties could render. All the returns I have now to make will be in those vows which I shall carry with me to my retirement and to my grave, that Heaven may continue to favor the people of the United States with the choicest tokens of its benificence; that their Union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free constitution which is the work of their own hands, may be sacredly maintained; that its administration in every department, may be stamped with wisdom and with virtue; and that this character may be ensured to it by that watchfulness over public servants and public measures, which on one hand will be necessary to prevent or correct a degeneracy; and that forbearance, on the other, from unfounded or indiscriminate jealousies which would deprive the public of the best services, by depriving a conscious integrity of one of the noblest incitements to perform them; that in fine, the happiness of the people of America, under the auspices of liberty, may be made compleat, by so careful a preservation, and so prudent a use of this blessing, as will acquire them the glorious satisfaction of recommending it to the affection, the praise, and the adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\nAnd may we not dwell with well grounded hopes on this flattering prospect; when we reflect on the many ties by which the people of America are bound together, and the many proofsthey have given of an enlightened judgment and a magnanimous patriotism.\nWe may all be considered as the children of one common country. We have all been embarked in one common cause. We have all had our share in common sufferings and common successes. The portion of the Earth allotted for the theatre of our fortunes, fulfils our most sanguine desires. All its essential interests are the same; whilst its diversities arising from climate from soil and from other local & lesser peculiarities, will naturally form a mutual relation of the parts, that may give to the whole a more entire independence than has perhaps fallen to the lot of any other nation.\nTo confirm these motives to an affectionate and permanent Union, and to secure the great objects of it, we have established a common Government, which being free in its principles, being founded in our own choice, being intended as the guardian of our common rights and the patron of our common interests, and wisely containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, as experience may point out its errors, seems to promise every thing that can be expected from such an institution; and if supported by wise councils, by virtuous conduct, and by mutual and friendly allowances, must approach as near to perfection as any human work can aspire, and nearer than any which the annals of mankind have recorded.\nWith these wishes and hopes I shall make my exit from civil life; & I have taken the same liberty of expressing them, which I formerly used in offering the Sentiments which were suggested by my exit from military life. If, in either instance, I have presumed more than I ought, on the indulgence of my fellow citizens, they will be too generous to ascribe it to any other cause than the extreme solicitude which I am bound to feel, and which I can never cease to feel, for their liberty, their prosperity and their happiness."

I think with you, that on this reduced scale it will be more easy for you to introduce the regular administration of laws.—\nIn proceeding to the establishment of laws you wish to adopt them from ours, & such only for the present as suit your present condition; chiefly indeed those for the punishment of crimes & the protection of property. but who is to determine which of our laws suit your condition & shall be in force with you? all of you being equally free, no one has a right to say what shall be law for the others— our way is to put these questions to the vote, and to consider that as law for which the Majority votes. the fool has as great a right to express his opinion, by vote, as the wise, because he is equally free & equally master of himself. but as it would be inconvenient for all your men to meet in one place, would it not be better for every Town to do as we do, that is to say, chuse by the vote of the Majority of the Town and of the country people nearer to that than to any other Town, one, two, three or more, according to the size of the Town, of those whom each voter thinks the wisest & honestest men of their place and let these meet together and agree which of our laws suit them. but these men know nothing of our laws. how then can they know which to adopt. let them associate in their Council our beloved man living with them, Colo. Meigs, and he will tell them what our law is on any point they desire. he will inform them also of our methods of doing business in our Councils so as to preserve order and to obtain the vote of every member fairly. this Council can make a law for giving to every head of a family a separate parcel of land, which when he has built upon and improved, it shall belong to him & his descendants forever, & which the Nation itself shall have no right to sell from under his feet. they will determine too what punishment shall be inflicted for every crime. in our States generally we punish murder only by death, and all other crimes by solitary confinement in a prison.\nBut when you shall have adopted Laws, who are to execute them? perhaps it may be best to permit every Town and the Settlers in it’s neighborhood attached to it, to Select some of their best men, by a Majority of its Voters to be Judges in all differences, and to execute the law according to their own judgment. Your Council of representatives will decide on this or such other mode as may best suit you. I suggest these things My Children for the consideration of the Upper Towns of your Nation, to be decided on as they think best, and I sincerely wish you may succeed in your laudable endeavors to save the remains of your Nation by adopting industrious Occupations and a Government of regular law. in this you may always rely on the counsel & assistance of the Government of the U.S.—deliver these words to your people in my name & assure them of my friendship\nTh:Jefferson"

    "content": "Quincy, November 3, 1809.\nSirs,\nThe black cloud that hung over the whole of the seven provinces; the solemn gloom that pervaded the whole nation; the universal uncertainty and timidity that had seized upon all minds, determined me to bring my own mission to a trial. If I should be rejected and ordered out of the country, our situation would not be worse. If I should be received, my object would be gained:—but if I should neither be received nor rejected, but takenad referendum, as the most intelligent men assured me I should be; I should then stand in a fair diplomatic character, waiting the result of the national deliberations, under the protection of the government, the public faith and the national honor. Both myself and my friends would be in a situation of more safety and security. I determined therefore to communicate my commission and credentials to the government: both to their High Mightinesses and to the Stadtholder. I wrote my memorials and signed them on the nineteenth of April, 1781: one to the States General, the other to the Prince of Orange. It was my wish that Mr. Luzac, who wrote admirably well in French, by the acknowledgment of all Europe, should translate the memorials into French, but Mr. Dumas was very desirous of performing that service: and Mr. Luzac undertook to get it translated into Dutch by his brother-in-law, a bookseller, printer and editor of a gazette at Delpht, who had the reputation of one of the most masterly writers in the nation in their own language.\nAmsterdam, April 27, 1781, wrote to Dr. Franklin: “I have received your excellency’s letter of the 21st, and will send you the list of the bills, and of the times of their becoming due, according to your desire, as soon as I can make it out. I will examine Mr. De Neufville’s bill, and if I find it good, accept it.\nFrom the time I received from Congress, their orders to borrow money here, I have constantly requested in my letters, that no draughts might be made upon me, until there should be news from me, that I had money to discharge them, and this request I shall repeat: But the cry of the army for cloaths, induces Congress to venture upon measures, which appear hazardous to us.—However, by the intelligence I have they had grounds to expect that the draughts hitherto made would be honoured.\nI have sometimes thought, however paradoxical it may seem, that one sett of bills protested would immediately procure Congress a Loan. No bills are in better credit than these. There is an appetite here for American trade as ravenous as that of a shark for his prey: and if they saw a prospect of having their commerce broken up, they would do much to save it.\nI have the honor to acquaint your excellency, that I sometime ago received from Congress full powers to conclude with the States General of the united provinces of the low countries, concerning a treaty of amity and commerce; and that I have very lately received a letter of credence as minister plenipotentiary to their High Mightinesses; and another to his serene Highness the Prince of Orange. Being thus fixed to this country for the present, I have taken a house in Amsterdam, on the Keizersgraht, near the Spiegal Straat, for the convenience of our countrymen who have occasion to visit me, and of merchants who have bills upon me, until their High Mightinesses shall have taken the necessary time to deliberate upon it and determine to acknowledge the independence of the United States, enter into treaties with them and receive me at the Hague. If this should happen I hope we should obtain a credit here? but we never shall before.”\nAbout this time, considering the connection between the United States and France, it was very obvious that prudence required I should communicate my design to the French Ambassador. I was not, however, without apprehensions of the consequence of it, for I could not doubt that the Count De Vergennes had information of my appointment sooner than I had, and I had a thousand reasons to believe that my whole system in Holland and even my residence in it was disagreeable to him. I might presume and I did presume that the Duke had instructions from the Count to counteract me. But the inconveniences that would arise from concealing my design from the French Ambassador, appearing to overbalance those in the other scale, I wrote to his excellency information that I had received from Congress full powers and credentials as a minister plenipotentiary to the States General and the Prince of Orange. I received a reply from the Duke immediately, “that he had received my letter, but that I had not informed him whether it was my design to present my full powers to their High Mightinesses: if such was my intention he desired a previous conference with me. I went immediately to the Hague and made my visit to the Hotel de France. The Duke entered at once into conversation with me to dissuade me from presenting my credentials. He detained me two hours. I answered all his questions, and replied to all his arguments. But as is usual, neither was convinced, and I took my leave with as full a determination as ever to pursue my plan. The next morning at eight o’clock, the Duke appeared at my lodgings at the principal inn of the city, at the sign of the Parliament of England, and renewed his efforts to divert me from my purpose. He went over all the ground we had trod the day before, and ran about all Europe, especially the northern maritime confederation, to find arguments against the step I proposed to take. Although his topics appeared to me extremely frivolous, I listened to them with all the respect which was due to the Ambassador of France, and to the personal character of the Duke which I sincerely esteemed. It is but justice to say that in all my intercourse with the Duke de la Vauguion, I was uniformly treated by him, his Dutchess, their children and domestics, with the utmost politeness, and indeed with the freedom and familiarity of friendship.\nIn this transaction I committed two faults: 1. In not insisting that these discussions should be in writing. 2. In not committing them to writing when they were fresh in my mind. The only excuse that can be made for both is that I had not time. Too many objects pressed upon me at once. At the distance of eight and twenty years it would be in vain to attempt a recollection of them by memory, and they must be lost forever unless some future Dalrymple or Fox, after a century or two, should find access to the diplomatic archieves of France and there find some account of them in the Duke’s dispatches to his court.\nThe Duke detained me between four and five hours at this second interview, urging all the time his objections and reasons against my going to the States. There was no solidity in them; I knew them to be mere pretexts.\nAt last, when he found I was not convinced, he desired me to postpone my visit to the President of their High Mightinesses, until he could write to the Count De Vergennes and have his opinion. I answered by no means: Why? Because I know beforehand the Count’s opinion will be point blank against me; and I had rather proceed against his judgment without officially knowing his opinion, than with it; as I am determined in all events to go. The Duke had one resource still left. It was to persuade me to join him or let him alone, in writing a request to the king of France that he would order his Ambassador to unite with me, in my endeavors to obtain an acknowledgment of my public character. I answered again by no means—Why? Because Monsieur Le Duke, if I must speak out in plain English, or plain French, I know the decision of the king’s Council will be directly and decidedly against me; and I am decidedly determined to go to the President, though I had a resolution of the king in counsel against me, and before my eyes. Besides, the moments are critical, and there is no time to be lost— whereas, the correspondence and negociations you propose may be spun out for years. Moreover, I think that neither the King nor his Ministers ought to commit themselves in this business. What! said the Duke? Will you take the responsibility of it upon yourself? Indeed, Monsieur Le Duke I will; and I think I alone ought to be responsible; and that no other ambassador, minister, counsel or court ought to be answerable for any thing concerning it. “Are you willing to be responsible then?” Indeed I am, and upon my head may all the consequences of it rest. “Are you then determined?” Determined, and unalterably determined I am.\nThe Duke upon hearing this, changed his countenance and the tone of his voice, and said very pleasantly—well I can say no more. If you are determined, and actually go to the States General, though it will be against my opinion and advice, and although I can give you no assistance in my official capacity, yet as a man and an individual I will give you all the countenance in my power. I thanked his Excellency for his declaration, which I received in the most friendly manner; and assured him it was all the aid I expected or desired, as I fully agreed with him that neither his public character or the conduct of his Court ought in any manner or degree to be compromised in the affair.\nNotwithstanding all this, after our treaty was made with Holland, the Count De Vergennes ordered the French minister to announce formally to Congress, in the name of the King, that his Majesty had assisted the United States in forming the connection between them and the States General of the United Provinces; and his Majesty received a formal vote of thanks from Congress for that favor.\nLeyden, May 3, 1781, wrote to Congress: “On the first day of May, I went to the Hague, and wrote to his Excellency Peter Van Bleiswick, grand pensioner of Holland, that having something of importance to communicate to him, I proposed to do myself the honor of waiting on him the next morning, at half after eight, if that time should be agreeable to him; but if any other hour would be more convenient, I requested his Excellency to mention it. The answer, which was not in writing, was, that half after eight should be the time. Accordingly, the next morning I waited on him, and was politely received. I informed him that I had asked his permission to make him this visit in order to communicate to him that I had received from my sovereign, the United States of America, full powers to treat with the States General, and a letter of credence as a Minister Plenipotentiary to their High Mightinesses; and another to his most Serene Highness the Prince; and that it was my intention to communicate those powers and letters to their High Mightinesses, and to his most Serene Highness, on Friday next, the 4th of May.\nHis Excellency said he would acquaint the States and his Highness with it; that in his private opinion, he thought favorably of it; but that he must wait the orders of his masters; that it was a matter somewhat delicate for the republic—I replied, that I hoped the delicacy of it, in the present state of open and declared war between England and Holland, would not be considered as an obstacle. That I thought it the interest of the republic, as well as of America, that they should unite.—His Excellency rejoined, “One thing is certain, we have a common enemy.”\nAs this was a visit simply to impart my design; and I knew enough of the delicate situation of this minister and of his reputed sentiments, to be sensible that he did not wish to enter into any very particular conversation at this time upon public affairs; I here rose to take my leave. His excellency asked me if I had any good news from America? I answered, none very late. He then said he should be glad to form an acquaintance with me. I answered this would be very flattering to me, and thus took my leave.\nTo-morrow morning I propose to go to the president of their High Mightinesses, to Secretary Fagel, and to the Secretary of the Prince of Orange. This moment, for the first time, I have received the congress account of Gen. Morgan’s glorious victory over Tarlton.”\nAmsterdam, May 7, 1781, wrote to Congress: “On the fourth of May, I did myself the honor to visit Peter Van Bleiswick, grand pensionary of Holland, and presented him with a letter containing a copy of my memorial to the States General, &c. His excellency said, that it was necessary for me to go to the President and Secretary of their High Mightinesses; and that it was not customary for foreign ministers to communicate any thing to the pensionary of Holland. I observed that I had been advised by the French Ambassador, (as indeed I had been by many others,) to present copies to him and they were only copies which I had the honor to offer him. He said he could not receive them: that I must go to the President; but said his excellency, it is proper for me to apprize you, that the President will make a difficulty, or rather will refuse to receive any letter or paper from you, because the state you say you represent is not yet acknowledged to be a sovereign state by the sovereign of this nation. The President will hear what you have to say to him; make report of it to their High Mightinesses; and they will transmit it to the several provinces, for the deliberation of the various members of the sovereignty. I thanked his excellency for this information, (though there was nothing in it new to me) and departed.\nI then presented myself to the President of their High Mightinesses for the week, the Barron Linden De Hemmen, a Deputy of the Province of Guelderland; to whom I communicated, that I had lately received from my sovereign, the United States of America in Congress assembled, a commission with full powers and instructions to treat with the States General, concerning a treaty of amity and commerce; that I had also received a letter of credence as minister plenipotentiary to their High Mightinesses; and requested him to lay before their High Mightinesses, either the originals, or a memorial, in which I had done myself the honor to state all these facts and to inclose copies.\nThe President said that he could not undertake to receive from me either the originals or any memorial; because America was not yet acknowledged as a sovereign state, by the sovereign of this country; but that he would make report to their High Mightinesses of all that I had said to him and that it would become the subject of deliberation in the several provinces. That he thought it a matter of great importance to the republic. I answered I was glad to hear him say he thought it important; for it appeared to me to be the interest of the two republics to become united. After having apprized him that in the present circumstances, I thought it would be my duty to make public my application to their High Mightinesses, I thanked him for his politeness and retired.\nI had prepared copies of the memorial and all the other papers for the secretary, Mr. Fagel: but as the President had refused to receive the originals, it was obviously inconsistent for the Secretary to receive copies. I therefore omitted the visit to his office.\nI then went to the Baron De Ray, the Secretary of the Prince, with a letter addressed to his most serene highness, containing a memorial informing him of my credentials to his court, and copies of the memorial to their High Mightinesses. The Secretary received me politely, accepted the letter, and promised to present it to the Stadtholder. He requested to know where I lodged? and was informed at the Parliament of England.\nHaving returned to my apartments in the inn, I heard about two hours afterwards, that the Prince had been to the assembly of the States General for about half an hour. In about another hour, the servant of the house announced to me the Baron De Ray. I went to receive him and invited him into my apartment; he entered and said, that he was charged on the part of the Prince with his Highness’ compliments to me, and to inform me, that as the independence of my country was not yet acknowledged by the sovereign of his, he could not receive the letter from me; and therefore requested that I would take it back, which I did respectfully. The secretary then politely said he was very much obliged to me for having given him an opportunity to see my person, and took his leave.\nThe president made report to their High Mightinesses, as soon as they assembled, and his report was ordered to be recorded. Whereupon the deputies of each of the seven provinces demanded copies of the record to be transmitted to the respective regencies for their deliberation and decision; or in the technical language of the laws of this country, it was takenad referendumon the same day.\nThe next morning I made a visit to the French Ambassador, the Duke De La Vauguion, and acquainted him with all the steps I had taken. He said he still persisted in his opinion that the time was not the most favourable; but as the measure was taken, he would as an individual (but not as an ambassador) support and promote it to the utmost of his power.\nIt would require a large space to explain all the reasons and motives which I had for choosing the present time in preference to a later; but I think I can demonstrate, that every moment’s delay would have been attended with danger and inconvenience. All Europe is in a crisis, and this ingredient thrown in at this time will have more effect, than at any other. At a future time I may enlarge upon this subject.\nAt the foot of this letter to congress I find in my hand writing a note, February 20, 1782. The late evacuation of the barrier towns and demolition of their fortifications, may serve as a comment on the Duke de la Vauguions opinion against the point of time. But if it shews that he was right for his country, it shews also, that I was right for mine. And the Dutch only have been wrong in being blind.\nI had been very busily and confidentially employed in consultations with my Dutch friends, many of whom were members of the sovereignty, and among the best characters and most respectable men in the nation. I had not taken a step without their advice and full approbation. They were unanimously of my opinion that our American negotiations both for a political and commercial connection, and for a loan of money should be kept as distinct as possible from all French influence. They were also unanimous for sending a copy in three languages to every member of the constitutional sovereignty in all the provinces, amounting in the whole to between four and five thousand persons. This was accordingly done. The Memorial you will have in the next letter.\nJohn Adams."

Have you parted? for you mention nothing of her. I know your Friendship continues; but perhaps she is with one of her Brothers. How do they all do?\nI have not yet receiv’d a Line from my dear old Friend your Mother. Pray tell me where she is, and how it is with her. Jonathan, who is now at Nantes, told me that she had a Lodging in Northumberland Court. I doubt her being comfortably accommodated there.\nIs Miss Barwell a little more at rest; or as busy as ever? Is she well? And how fares it with our good Friends of the Henckel Family?\nBut principally I want to know how it is with you. I hear you have not yet quite settled with those People. I hope, however, that you have a sufficient Income, and live at your Ease; and that your Money is safe out of the Funds. Does my Godson remember anything of his Doctor Papa? I suppose not. Kiss the dear little Fellow for me, not forgetting the others. I long to see them and you.\nWhat became of the Lottery Tickit I left with your good Mother, which was to produce the Diamond Earings for you? Did you get them? If not, Fortune has wrong’d you! For yououghtto have had them. I am, my dear Friend, ever yours, with sincere Esteem and Affection.\nIf you write to me, direct for me thusA Monsr. Monsieur François, chez M. de Chaumont à Passy, près de Paris.\nP.S.27th Jany. They tell me that in writing to a Lady fromParis, one should always say something about the Fashions. Temple observes them more than I do. He took Notice that at the Ball in Nantes, there were no Heads less than 5, and a few were 7 Lengths of the Face, above the Top of the Forehead. You know that those who have practis’d Drawing, as he has, attend more to Proportions, than People in common do. Yesterday we din’d at the Duke de Rochefocault’s, where there were three Dutchesses and a Countess, and no Head higher than a Face and a half. So it seems the farther from Court the more extravagant the Mode."

Your sentiments of the importance of the present dispute between Great-Britain and the colonies appear to me extremely just. There is nothing I wish for more than to see it amicably and equitably settled. But Providence will bring about its own ends by its own means; and if it intends the downfal of a nation, that nation will be so blinded by its pride and other passions as not to see its danger, or how its fall may be prevented.\nBeing born and bred in one of the countries, and having lived long, and made many agreeable connections of friendship in the other, I wish all prosperity to both; but I have talked and writtenso much and so long on the subject, that my acquaintances are weary of hearing, and the public of reading any more of it; which begins to make me weary of talking and writing for them, especially as I do not find that I have gained any point in either country, except that of rendering myself suspected by my impartiality; in England of being too much an American, and in America of being too much an Englishman. Your opinion, however, weighs with me, and encourages me to try one effort more in a full though concise statement of facts, accompanied with arguments drawn from those facts, to be published about the meeting of Parliament after the holidays.\nIf any good may be done I shall rejoice; but at present I almost despair.\nHave you ever seen the barometer so low as of late? The 22d instant mine was at 28, 41, and yet the weather fine and fair. With sincere esteem, I am, dear friend, yours affectionately,\nB.Franklin."

For me, it is fortunate you did not, as I have disposed of them on terms infinitely more advantageous, whether the purchaser is able to comply with his Contract, or not; In the first case I shall get Two hundred thousand dollars for my land, with an interest of 6 pr Ct pr Annum until the whole sum is paid within ten years—and in the second case, that is, not being able to become the purchaser (within that period) in fee, I shall have my land well settled by Tenants. Thirty, late in the season as it was before any attempt was made to procure them, are now on the Land with fine Crops growing—forty more are engaged to go on this Fall; and as many as could be wished, ready to follow, as fast as Provisions can be provided for them. If I am not certain therefore of getting the money at the time stipulated, I shall be certain of having the land rendered infinitely more valuable by mean⟨s⟩ of the Improvements, & interest in the meantime.\nSince disposing of my Kanhawa lands on the terms just mentioned, I have sold the smallest of my tracts on the Ohio River for ten dollars an Acre, to be paid for in part with improved property in Alexandria, to be valued by three impartial & disinterested Gentlemen: one to be chosen by each of the Parties and the third by them two—and the remainder in Cash within Seven years with an Interest of 6 pr Ct pr Ann. until discharged.\nI have remaining on the Ohio River between the two Kanhawas three other tracts—viz.—the uppermost ⟨one,⟩ about ⟨15⟩ Miles below Marietta, and opposite to the Village of ⟨Bou⟩pre (which is on the No. West side) contains 2314 acres—the next about ⟨15⟩ miles lower down appertaining to which as I am informed is a very valuable Mill seat contains ⟨some 2448⟩ acres—and the third tract opposite to the great Bend in the river, and four or five miles below the last mentioned tract contains ⟨4395⟩ acres; and together, are bounded by the River Ohio for ⟨13⟩ miles nearly ⟨illegible⟩ They are I believe, all Intervale, & amongst the most valuable on the Ohio in the part they lye. There Situation, on many accounts is greatlyto be preferred to those on the Kanhawa while the quality of the Soil I should presume, is equally rich and good. I have been in treaty for the middle tract at ten dollars an Acre, & a thousand dollars for the Mill seat; but as the person has been longer determining than he was allowed, and as I am assured by those who know the land well, that I may be certain of getting the price (I ask)—that is, ten dollars an Acre round. I ⟨felt⟩ my self under no obligation to wait longer for his answer; and therefore, after ⟨making known⟩ these details, in order not only to let you see what my own ideas are of the value of my western lands, but the ideas entertained of them by ⟨others, Iillegible⟩ unequivocal evidence that can be given—viz.—the actual purchase of them.\nI shall proceed if you are still disposed to remove into the Western Country, to offer you these three tracts, for your ⟨Sugarland⟩ tract entire—Provided upon a view of it I shall like your land; for I ⟨am quite⟩ a stranger to it—allowing you to do the same ⟨illegible⟩ land before any bargain is closed. You may ⟨marvel⟩ at the small quantity (considering ⟨wh⟩ere it lyes) I offer for yours; but persuaded as I am that I offer a full equivalent invalueI can ⟨offer no⟩ more—I have 3000 Acres ⟨on⟩ the No. Wt side of the Ohio, in the neighbourhood of Cincinnati, which if you incline to ⟨illegible⟩ with the land on which you live & we can agree on terms, may go ⟨also inillegible—which wouldillegible⟩out of the Western Country ⟨illegible⟩ With esteem I am Sir ⟨illegible⟩\nGo: Washington"

And many who have not scrupled to examine for themselves, have yet for certain prudent reasons been cautious, and diffident of declaring the result of their enquiries.\nThe cause of this timidity is perhaps hereditary and to be traced back in history, as far as the cruel treatment the first settlers of this country received, before their embarkation for America, from the government at Home. Every body knows how dangerous it was to speak or write in favour of any thing in those days, but the triumphant system of religion and politicks. And our fathers were particularly, the objects of the persecutions and proscriptions of the times. It is not unlikely therefore, that, although they were inflexibly steady in refusing their positive assent to any thing against their principles, they might have contracted habits of reserve, and a cautious diffidence of asserting their opinions publickly. These habits they probably brought with them to America, and have transmitted down to us. Or, we may possibly account for this appearance, by the great affection and veneration, Americans have always entertained for the country from whence they sprang—or by the quiet temper for which they have been remarkable, no country having been less disposed to discontent than this—or by a sense they have, that it is their duty to acquiesce, under the administration of government, even when in many smaller matters gravaminous to them, and until the essentials of the great compact are destroy’d or invaded. These peculiar causes might operate upon them; but without these we all know, that human nature itself, from indolence, modesty, humanity or fear, has always too much reluctance to a manly assertion of its rights. Hence perhaps it has happened that nine tenths of the species, are groaning and gasping in misery and servitude.\nBut whatever the cause has been, the fact is certain, we have been excessively cautious of giving offence by complaining of grievances. And it is as certain that American governors, and their friends and all the crown officers have avail’d themselves of this disposition in the people. They have prevailed on us to consent to many things, which were grosly injurious to us, and to surrender many others with voluntary tameness, to which we had the clearest right. Have we not been treated formerly, with abominable insolence, by officers of the navy? I mean no insinuation against any gentleman now on this station, having heard no complaint of any one of them to his dishonor. Have not some generals, from England, treated us like servants, nay more like slaves than like Britons? Have we not been under the most ignominious contribution, the most abject submission, the most supercilious insults of some custom house officers? Have we not been trifled with, browbeaten, and trampled on, by former governors, in a manner which no king of England since James the second has dared to indulge towards his subjects? Have we not raised up one family, in them placed an unlimitted confidence, and been soothed and battered and intimidated by their influence, into a great part of this infamous tameness and submission? “These are serious and alarming questions, and deserve a dispassionate consideration.”\nThis disposition has been the great wheel and the mainspring in the American machine of court politicks. We have been told that “the word ’Rights’ is an offensive expression.” That “the King his ministry and parliament will not endure to hear Americans talk of their Rights.” That “Britain is the mother and we the children, that a filial duty and submission is due from us to her,” and that “we ought to doubt our own judgment, and presume that she is right, even when she seems to us to shake the foundations of government.” That “Britain is immensely rich and great and powerful, has fleets and armies at her command, which have been the dread and terror of the universe, and that she will force her own judgment into execution, right or wrong.” But let me intreat you Sir to pause and consider. Do you consider your self as a missionary of loyalty or of rebellion? Are you not representing your King his ministry and parliament as tyrants, imperious, unrelenting tyrants by such reasoning as this? Is not this representing your most gracious sovereign, as endeavouring to destroy the foundations of his own throne? Are you not putting language into the royal mouth, which if fairly pursued will shew him to have no right to the crown on his own sacred head? Are you not representing every member of parliament as renouncing the transactions at Running­mede, and as repealing in effect the bill of rights, when the Lords and Commons asserted and vindicated the rights of the people and their own rights, and insisted on the King’s assent to that assertion and vindication? Do you not represent them as forgetting that the prince of Orange, was created King William by the People, on purpose that their rights might be eternal and inviolable? Is there not something extremely fallacious, in the common-place images of mother country and children colonies? Are we the children of Great-Britain, any more than the cities of London, Exeter and Bath? Are we not brethren and fellow subjects, with those in Britain, only under a somewhat different method of legislation, and a totally different method of taxation? But admitting we are children; have not children a right to complain when their parents are attempting to break their limbs, to administer poison, or to sell them to enemies for slaves? Let me intreat you to consider, will the mother, be pleased, when you represent her as deaf to the cries of her children? When you compare her to the infamous miscreant, who lately stood on the gallows for starving her child? When you resemble her to Lady Macbeth in Shakespear, (I cannot think of it without horror)\nWho “had given suck, and knew\nHow tender ’twas to love the Babe that milk’d her.”\nBut yet, who could\n“Even while ’twas smiling in her Face,\nHave pluck’d her Nipple from the boneless Gums,\nAnd dash’d the Brains out.”\nLet us banish forever from our minds, my countrymen, all such unworthy ideas of the King, his ministry and parliament. Let us not suppose, that all are become luxurious effeminate and unreasonable, on the other side the water, as many designing persons would insinuate. Let us presume, what is in fact true, that the spirit of liberty, is as ardent as ever among the body of the nation, though a few individuals may be corrupted. Let us take it for granted, that the same great spirit, which once gave Caesar so warm a reception; which denounced hostilities against John ’till Magna Charta was signed; which severed the head of Charles the first from his body, and drove James the second from his kingdom; the same great spirit (may heaven preserve it till the earth shall be no more) which first seated the great grand father of his present most gracious Majesty, on the throne of Britain, is still alive and active and warm in England; and that the same spirit in America, instead of provoking the inhabitants of that country, will endear us to them for ever and secure their good will.\nThis spirit however without knowledge, would be little better than a brutal rage. Let us tenderly and kindly cherish, therefore the means of knowledge. Let us dare to read, think, speak and write. Let every order and degree among the people rouse their attention and animate their resolution. Let them all become attentive to the grounds and principles of government, ecclesiastical and civil. Let us study the law of nature; search into the spirit of the British constitution; read the histories of ancient ages; contemplate the great examples of Greece and Rome; set before us, the conduct of our own British ancestors, who have defended for us, the inherent rights of mankind, against foreign and domestic tyrants and usurpers, against arbitrary kings and cruel priests, in short against the gates of earth and hell. Let us read and recollect and impress upon our souls, the views and ends, of our own more immediate forefathers, in exchanging their native country for a dreary, inhospitable wilderness. Let us examine into the nature of that power and the cruelty of that oppression which drove them from their homes. Recollect their amazing fortitude, their bitter sufferings! The hunger, the nakedness, the cold, which they patiently endured! The severe labours of clearing their grounds, building their houses, raising their provisions amidst dangers from wild beasts and savage men, before they had time or money or materials for commerce! Recollect the civil and religious principles and hopes and expectations, which constantly supported and carried them through all hardships, and patience and resignation! Let us recollect it was liberty! The hope of liberty for themselves and us and ours, which conquered all discouragements, dangers and trials! In such researches as these let us all in our several departments chearfully engage! But especially the proper patrons and supporters of law, learning and religion.\nLet the pulpit resound with the doctrines and sentiments of religious liberty. Let us hear the danger of thraldom to our consciences, from ignorance, extream poverty and dependance, in short from civil and political slavery. Let us see delineated before us, the true map of man. Let us hear the dignity of his nature, and the noble rank he holds among the works of God! that consenting to slavery is a sacriligious breach of trust, as offensive in the sight of God, as it is derogatory from our own honor or interest or happiness; and that God almighty has promulgated from heaven, liberty, peace, and good-will to man!\nLet the Bar proclaim, “the laws, the rights, the generous plan of power,” delivered down from remote antiquity; inform the world ofthe mighty struggles, and numberless sacrifices, made by our ancestors, in defence of freedom. Let it be known, that British liberties are not the grants of princes or parliaments, but original rights, conditions of original contracts, coequal with prerogative and coeval with government.—That many of our rights are inherent and essential, agreed on as maxims and establish’d as preliminaries, even before a parliament existed. Let them search for the foundations of British laws and government in the frame of human nature, in the constitution of the intellectual and moral world. There let us see, that truth, liberty, justice and benevolence, are its everlasting basis; and if these could be removed, the superstructure is overthrown of course.\nLet the colleges join their harmony, in the same delightful concern. Let every declamation turn upon the beauty of liberty and virtue, and the deformity, turpitude and malignity of slavery and vice. Let the public disputations become researches into the grounds and nature and ends of government, and the means of preserving the good and demolishing the evil. Let the dialogues and all the exercises, become the instruments of impressing on the tender mind, and of spreading and distributing, far and wide, the ideas of right and the sensations of freedom.\nIn a word, let every sluice of knowledge be open’d and set a flowing. The encroachments upon liberty, in the reigns of the first James and the first Charles, by turning the general attention of learned men to government, are said to have produced the greatest number of consummate statesmen, which has ever been seen in any age, or nation. Your Clarendons, Southamptons, Seldens, Hampdens, Faulklands, Sidneys, Locks, Harringtons, are all said to have owed their eminence in political knowledge, to the tyrannies of those reigns. The prospect, now before us, in America, ought in the same manner to engage the attention of every man of learning to matters of power and of right, that we may be neither led nor driven blindfolded to irretrievable destruction. Nothing less than this seems to have been meditated for us, by somebody or other in Great-Britain. There seems to be a direct and formal design on foot, to enslave all America. This however must be done by degrees. The first step that is intended seems to be an entire subversion of the whole system of our Fathers, by an introduction of the cannon and feudal law, into America. The cannon and feudal systems tho’ greatly mutilated in England, are not yet destroy’d. Like the temples and palaces, in which the great contrivers of them, once worship’d and inhabited, they exist in ruins; and much of the domineering spirit of them still remains. The designs and labours of a cer­tain society, to introduce the former of them into America, have been well exposed to the public by a writer of great abilities, and the further attempts to the same purpose that may be made by that society, or by the ministry or parliament, I leave to the conjectures of the thoughtful. But it seems very manifest from the S—p A-t itself, that a design is form’d to strip us in a great measure of the means of knowledge, by loading the Press, the Colleges, and even an Almanack and a News-Paper, with restraints and duties; and to introduce the inequalities and dependances of the feudal system, by taking from the poorer sort of people all their little subsistance, and conferring it on a set of stamp officers, distributors and their deputies. But I must proceed no further at present. The sequel, whenever I shall find health and leisure to pursue it, will be a “disquisition of the policy of the stamp act.” In the mean time however let me add, These are not the vapours of a melancholly mind, nor the effusions of envy, disappointed ambition, nor of a spirit of opposition to government: but the emanations of an heart that burns, for its country’s welfare. No one of any feeling, born and educated in this once happy country, can consider the numerous distresses, the gross indignities, the barbarous ignorance, the haughty usurpations, that we have reason to fear are meditating for ourselves, our children, our neighbours, in short for all our countrymen and all their posterity, without the utmost agonies of heart, and many tears."

I am with great Respect and Esteem Sir your most obedient humble Servant\nGo. Washington"

It will stop I suppose any such actions which might have come on from the Eastward and thus leave our Enemies to conclude against us from the Silence of our friends. Moreover it will enable your personal Enemies to say that you wished the Repeal to take Effect so as to overturn the Constitution, and weakminded friends may be hurt that the Bar of a State shd. hold themselves too high to petition the Legislature of the Union. However what is done cannot be undone.\nWould it not be useful to establish Committees of Correspondence from Baltimore to Boston of which New Yk. to be the Center as being a more favorable Position to collect opinions thro that Tract of Country? If a general meeting of the Citizens of New York should be convened it might be for the Purpose of “considering what constitutional measures can be adopted in the present moment to secure the Independence of the State and the national Compact of the Union from the Dangers with which they are threatened.” At such Meeting it might be useful to appoint a large Committee chiefly of merchants composed ofmoderate men. You should not appear in all this. They will soon catch an Esprit de Corps. These may report simply Resolutions that the Repeal is inexpedient that a Petition be presented to the President and that a Committee be appointed to correspond with other Committees. This corresponding Committee selected from the first andappointed by the Peoplemay consist of the most intelligent andmoderate men. In a few Weeks they will find Business for themselves and for Mr. President too. The Petition might state 1st. That the Law to be repealed is considered as useful and tending to the speedy Administration of Justice 2ly That the Expence compared with the Object or with the general Amount of Expenditure is trifling. 3ly That Respect forbids the Idea which has been suggested by some that the principal Object of the Repeal is to get Rid of obnoxious Judges that whatever may be the Characters of those who sit in other Circuits those of the second Circuit have deserved the public Confidence 4ly. That without questioning the Powers of Congress it appears a Point of such Magnitude and the Result if the Law be unconstitutional which is the Opinion of many cool and discerning Men is fraught with such Danger that the Petitioners hope he will interfere to prevent a Decision and thereby quiet the minds of manyreal friends to the national government and the Independence of the several States who view with extreme Anxiety the present Situation of our Affairs."

    "content": "[5 Apr. 1784]\nThe Grand Committee consisting of appointed to prepare and report to Congress the arrears of interest on the National debt, together with the interest and expences for the year 1784. from the first to the last day thereof inclusive, and a requisition of money on the States for discharging the same, have agreed to the following report.\nResolved that there will be wanting for arrears of interest, and for the interest and services of the present year 1784, from the first to the last day thereof inclusive, the following sums expressed in Dollars, tenths, and hundredths of Dollars.,\nThe Committee were apprized that the resolutions of Congress of Apr. the 18th. 1783. had recommended to the several states the raising an annual revenue by the establishment of certain imposts for the purpose of discharging the national debt, principal and interest. But it occurred to them that those recommendations were still before several of the legislatures; that however desireable a compliance therewith is, for the preservation of our faith, and establishment of a national Credit yet as time has already elapsed, and more must elapse before their final confirmation can be hoped, as, after it shall be obtained time will also be requisite to advance the plan to the term of actual collection, good faith requires that in the mean while other measures should be resorted to for the purpose of discharging the growing interest.\nIn the statement of the interest due at the close of the year 1782. the Committee have supposed it’s amount lessened by 1,200,000 dollars required and apportioned by the resolutions of Congress of Sep. the 4th. and 10th. 1782. and appropriated to the sole purpose of paying the interest of the public debt. This requisition gave license to the states to apply so much as should be necessary of their respective quotas of it, to the payment of interest due on certificates issued from the loan offices of their own states, and otherliquidated debts of the United states contracted therein. Hence they suppose it has happened that the actual payment of these quotas have been uncommunicated to the Office of finance for the United states. The Committee are of opinion that the states should be desired to communicate to the Superintendant of finance the payments they have made under this requisition, and where they have been incomplete, to hasten their completion as the means still relied on by Congress for the discharge of that part of the interest of the public debt.—And while on this subject they beg leave to add that from the representation to Congress by the Minister of France, referred to this committee, they learn that in some of the states a discrimination has taken place between the citizens of their own, and subjects or citizens of other countries, which was not authorized by the said resolution: they are of opinion that such states should be requested to revise and reform their proceedings herein; and to extend the benefits of this provision equally and impartially to all persons within it’s description.\nYour Committee came then to consider in what way it would be best to call for the sums requisite for the services before stated, and they thought it their duty in the first place to enquire whether no surpluses might remain on former requisitions of Congress after the purposes were effected to which they were originally appropriated; under an assurance that it would be both the duty and sense of Congress to apply such surpluses, in every instance, towards lessening the next requisitions on the states. They found in fact that such a surplus would remain on the requisition of Oct. 30 1781. for eight millions of Dollars for the services of the ensuing year; and that this surplus would be great from the following circumstances. That requisition was estimated on supposition that the Continental army would be completed by the states to it’s full establishment, and that cloathing, subsistence and other necessaries for such an army must of course be provided. The states were far short of producing such an army. Hence the calls for money were proportionably abridged. It was estimated too on the further supposition that we might be disappointed in the endeavors we were then exerting to borrow money both at home and abroad, and of course that the whole must be supplied by taxes. Loans however were obtained and the surplus increased by this second cause. A third circumstance has further enlarged it. The payments on this requisition have been small and slow. Hence, instead of money, those who served and supplied the United states have received certificates only that money is due to them, and these debtshave been transferred to the fund proposed to be raised by way of impost. So that tho’ the debts exist, they are removed from this to another fund. To know then the amount of this surplus, the Committee extended their enquiries to the sums actually received under this requisition, the purposes to which they have been applied, and the anticipations thereof still unsatisfied. They found that 1,486,511.71 only of the eight millions of Dollars had been received at the treasury at the close of the year 1783: that these had been applied to the services of the years 1782 and 1783: and that for other services of the same years debts were contracted to the amount of about one million of dollars more, which depend for their discharge on further receipts under this requisition. Your Committee then are of opinion that a surplus of 5,513,488.28 Dollars will remain of this requisition after answering all the demands which actually arose against it, which were not answered by other means, nor transferred to other funds and that this surplus ought to be applied so far as it will go, to the common purposes of the United states, so as to prevent new requisitions on them till the old shall have been exhausted, and to shew to those who may have paid their whole quota of any requisition that they will not be called on anew till all the other states shall in like manner have paid up their quotas.\nYour Committee found also that there was a requisition of Congress of Oct. 16. 1782. for 2. millions of Dollars for the services of the year 1783, on which some small payments had been tendered, but that the Superintendant of finance had found it better to receive and credit them as part of the eight millions. They are accordingly comprehended in the sum before stated to have been paid in under that head.\nHaving thus stated the demands existing against the states, the Committee would have performed but half their duty had they passed over unnoticed their condition to pay them. Their abilities must be measured in weighing their burthens. Their creditors themselves will view them just relieved from the ravages of predatory armies, returning from an attendance on camps to the culture of their feilds, beginning to sow, but not yet having reaped, exhausted of necessaries and habitual comforts and therefore needing new supplies out of the first proceeds of their labour. Forbearance then, to a certain degree, will suggest itself to them. Those entrusted with the dispensation of justice between them will suppose both parties desirous that their mutual situations should beconsidered and accomodated. Your Committee are of opinion that if the whole balances of the two requisitions of eight and of two millions should be rigorously called into payment within the course of the present year, a compliance with such call would produce much distress; and that some term short of this should be fixed on, within the reach of the least as well as of the most able states. They propose therefore that the states be required to furnish within the course of the present year such part of their deficiences under the requisition of 8. millions, as, with their payments to the close of the last year, will make up three fourths of their original quota thereof: and that these payments be appropriated to the services of the present year 1784, in conformity with the statement in the first part of this report, giving generally, where accomodation cannot be effected among the several objects, a preference according to the order in which they are arranged in the said statement.\nBut while this proportion of former deficiencies is of necessity called for under the pressure of demands which will admit neither denial nor delay, the Committee must acknolege that even the punctual compliance expected from all the states will not effect completely all the purposes of their preceding statement.\nTo accomplish these perfectly; to enable the federal administration to fulfill the whole of those just and desireable objects, they wish earnestly and warmly to encourage the abler states to go as far beyond this proportion as their happier situation will admit, under an assurance that their further contributions will be applied towards reducing the interest and principal of the public debt, and will be placed to their credit in the next requisitions, with interest thereon from the time of payment.\nIndividual states have at times thought it hard that while, in their own opinion, they were in advance for the United states on accounts existing and unsettled between them, they should yet be called on to furnish actual contributions of money. The Committee observe in answer to this, first, that almost every state thinks itself in advance: and secondly that it has been the constant wish of Congress that these accounts should be settled, and the contributions of each be known and credited. They have accordingly put it in the power of the states to effect these settlements: and as a further encouragement to hasten this desireable work, the Committee are of opinion Congress should declare that so soon as these accounts shall be all settled, and it shall appear in favor of what states balances arise, such states shall have credit for the same in the requisitions next ensuing.\nBut it will be necessary also to remind the states that no materials have yet been furnished to enable Congress to adjust the ultimate ratio in which the expenditures of the late war shall be apportioned on the states. The Confederation directs that this shall be regulated by the value of the lands in the several states with the buildings and improvements thereon. Experiments made however since the date of that instrument for the purposes of ordinary taxation had induced doubts as to the practicability of this rule of apportionment. Yet Congress thought it their duty to give it fair trial, and recommended to the several states on the 17th. of Feb. 1783. to furnish an account of their lands buildings and number of inhabitants, whereon they might proceed to estimate their respective quotas. But apprehending that the incompetence of the rule would immediately shew itself, and desirous that no time should be unnecessarily lost, they followed it with another recommendation of the 18th. of Apr. 1783. to substitute in lieu of that article in the Confederation another which should make the number of inhabitants, under certain modifications the measure of contribution for each state. Both these propositions are still under reference to the several legislatures; the latter accompanied by the earnest wishes and preference of Congress, under full conviction that it will be found in event as equal, more satisfactory, and more easy of execution: the former only pressed if the other should be rejected. The Committee is informed that the states of Connecticut, New Jersey, Pensylvania and S. Carolina have acceded to the alteration proposed; but have no evidence that the other states have as yet decided thereon. As it is necessary that the one or the other measure should be immediately resorted to, they are of opinion it should be recommended to the legislatures which have not yet decided between them, to come to decision at their next meeting.\nIn order to present to the eye a general view of the several existing requisitions and of the payments made under them, the Committee has subjoined them in the form of a table, wherein the 1st column enumerates the states: the 2d. the apportionment of the 1,200,000 D. the 3d. that of the 8. Millions: the 4th. that of the 2. Millions, the 5th the sums paid by the several states in part of their respective quotas to the last day of the year 1783. and the 6th. the sums now required to make up three fourths of their respective quotas of the 8. Millions, expressed in Dolls. 10ths. and 100ths. of Dolls.\nIt remained lastly to consider whether no facilities might be given to the paiment of these sums by the several states. The Committee observed that of the purposes for which money is wanting, about a moiety can be answered by nothing but money itself, but that the other moiety, consisting of interest on our domestic debt, may be effected by procuring a discount of the demand in the hands of the holders; an operation which will be shorter and less impoverishing to the State. And however, in times of greater plenty, the accuracy of fiscal administration might require all transactions to be in actual money, at the treasury itself; yet till our constituents shall have had respite from their late difficulties, it behoves us to prefer their easement. The Committee are therefore of opinion that the several legislatures may be admitted so to model the collection of the sums now called for as that, the one half being paid in actual money, the other may be discharged by procuring discounts of interest with our domestic creditors; only taking care that the collection of money shall proceed at least in equal pace with the operations of discount. And to ascertain the evidence of discount which shall be receivable in lieu of money, the holders of loan office certificates shall be at liberty to carry them to the office from which they issued; and the holders of certificates of other liquidated debts of the United states, to carry the same to the loan office of that state wherein the debt was contracted, and to have the interest due thereon settled and certified to the last day of the year 1783; for which interest the loan officer shall give acertificate in such form, and under such cautions and instructions as the Superintendant of finance shall transmit to him, which certificates of interest, being parted with by the holder of the principal, shall be deemed evidence that he has received satisfaction for the same, and therefore shall be receivable from the bearer, within the same state, in lieu of money in the proportion before stated. And where loan office certificates, issued after the 1st. day of Mar. 1778. shall be presented to the loan officer, they shall be reduced to their specie value, according to the resolutions of Congress of June 28. 1780. that specie value expressed on some part of the certificate, and the interest thereon settled and certified as in other cases."

I put both the last under cover to you, not knowing what regard may be due to Newspaper authority, that the Marquis is under the open displeasure of the Court, and may therefore be the less likely to receive letters thro’ any other channel. Sometimes the report runs that he is in the Bastile; at another that he is at the head of a revolt in some one of the Provinces.\nMy last letters have followed each other so quickly and the last of all is of such recent date, that this opportunity by a gentleman going to France, enables me to add little to what has been already communicated. The result of the Meeting at Harrisburg was the latest event worthy of notice at the date of my last. Nothing has since taken place in relation to the New Government, but the appointment of Mr. Robt. Morris, and a Mr. McClay, to represent Pennsylvania in the Senate. A law has also passed in that State providing for the election of members for the House of Reps. and of electors of the President. The Act proposes that every Citizen throughout the State shall vote for the whole number of members allotted to the State. This mode of election will confine the choice to characters of general notoriety, and so far be favorable to merit. It is however liable to some popular objections urged agst. the tendency of the new System. In Virginia, I am inclined to think the State will be divided into as many districts, as there are to be members. In other States, as in Connecticut the Pena. example will probably be followed. And in others again a middle course be taken. It is perhaps to be desired that various modes should be tried, as by that means only the best mode can be ascertained. There is no doubt that Genl. Washington will be called to the Presidency. For the vice Presidency, are talked of principally Mr. Hancock & Mr. Adams. Mr. Jay or Genl. Knox would I believe bepreferred to either, but both of them will probably chuse to remain where they are. It is impossible to say which of the former would be preferred, or what other Candidates may be brought forward.\nI have a letter from Mr. George Lee Turberville of Virginia requesting me to mention to you a report proceeding from Greenwich that a Docr. Spence and his lady, (the former a Virginian of respectable family in the lower End of the Northern Neck, and whose mother is still living, in a second marriage with a Docr. Thomson of Westmoreland County) were captured on their way to Virginia and carried into Algiers. This event is said to have happened seven or eight years ago, though discovered but lately, it having been taken for granted that the vessel and all on board had perished at sea. I am much inclined to believe that this supposition is the true one, and that the Greenwich story has no foundation. I communicate it nevertheless as requested by Mr. Turberville, that you may have an opportunity of collecting for the friends of Docr. Spence any information which may be interesting to them, and of taking any steps that such information may suggest in behalf of the distressed.\nI have already acquainted you with the result of my enquiries in the case of Mrs. Burke. The effects in the hands of Wm. S. Brown had been delivered over to a Mr. Kemble a respectable mercht. here, who is admtr. to the deceased Burke and who tells me that the whole Estate of the latter does not pay his debts.\nI shall send along with this a few seed of the sugar maple, the first & the whole that I have been able to obtain. I wish you all happiness & remain Dr. Sir Yrs. most Affecly.\nJs. Madison Jr."

    "content": "[November 1793]\nThe Commissioners charged with the settlement of Accounts between the United & the Individual States completed that important business within the time limited by Law; and the ballances which they have reported have been placed upon the Books of the Treasury. A copy of their Report bearing date the[ ]day of[ ]last will be laid before Congress for their information.\nThe importance of the object will justify me in recalling to your consideration the expediency of a regular and adequate provision for the Redemption and Discharge of the Public Debt. Several obvious considerations render the œconomy of time, in relation to this measure, peculiarly interesting and desireable.\nIt is necessary, that provision should be also made for paying the second installment of the loan of two Millions from the Bank of the U. States agreeably to the terms of that loan; the first having been paid, pursuant to the provision for that purpose made during the last session.\non the first day of June last an installment of 1000000 of florins became payable on the loans of the U. States in Holland. This was adjusted by a prolongation of the period of reimbusement, in nature of a new loan at an interest of 5 per Cent, for the term of ten years. The charges upon this operation were a commission ofthreeper Cent. It will readily be perceived that the posture of European affairs is calculated to affect unfavourably the measures of the U.S. for borrowing abroad.\nThe productiveness of the public Revenues hitherto has continued to equal the anticipations which were formed of it; but it is not expected that it will prove commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested. Some auxiliary provisions will, therefore, it is presumed, be requisite; but these it is hoped can be made consistently with a due regard to the convenience of our citizens, who cannot but be sensible of the true wisdom of encountering a small present addition to their contribution for the public service, to avoid a future accumulation of burthens."

It is of great consequence not to Let them range about freely, under the expectation that we are in every minute of a convoy from France. It appears for certain that the Chatham of 50. guns from Charlestown has joined the Enemy’s fleet.

    "content": "Richmond April 19. 1780\nSir\nYourLetter from Louisville of February 22’d—80 came safely to Hand. In Answer to your Observations on the Spot proper to take Post on at the Mouth of Ohio we can only give our general Sentiments leaving the Ultimate Determination to your Prudence on view of the Ground, as we can neither make the particular spot we would elect to be what we should wish nor recommend to you to take Post on it if Nature has rendered it unfit.\nThe Point of Land at the Mouth of the Ohio on the South side is the precise spot which would have been preferred had nature formed it capable of Fortification but this we were apprised was subject to inundation. How deep the Waters may occasionally be there, we are quite uninformed, and therefore are unable to decide on your Proposition for banking them out as at New-Orleans. In general, undertakings of that nature are expensive, and not without great Danger that Floods of unexpected Magnitude may overwhelm the Works and Garrison, or that an enterprizing Enemy may find Means to let in the Water. Yet if those Lands lie so high as to be very little under Water, these objections become small in proportion, and may perhaps be less than that of taking the Post at a situation less favorable for vigilance over the Trade of the two rivers. Of this you will judge when you see the Lands and knowthe height of Inundation they are subject to. If this Place should be rejected, and we were to decide between two Posts one of which should be on the Ohio, the other on the Missisipi below the Mouth of Ohio equally near the Mouth, and equally proper in every other respect, we should prefer the one on the Missisipi because it would command a greater Part of the Trade than the other; for I take for granted more Trade will go down the two Rivers to Orleans than down one river to the Mouth and up the other. If the question is between two Situations on the North and South side of the Ohio, equal in other respects, the one on the South side would be greatly preferred. Indeed this circumstance would weigh against a good Degree of other Superiority for Reasons which cannot be trusted to a Letter: Yet it would not so far weigh as to prefer a Post which cannot be made tenable to one which can. You describe a high Ground on the North side of the Ohio, three or four Miles above its Mouth, yet the Missisipi, so near in that Part as that a Town might reach from the one to the other and a small river mouthing at the same Place and forming a commodious Harbor for Vessels. This indeed is tempting, as in such a case the Navigation of both rivers would lie under your Eye as effectually as at the Mouth of Ohio, and holds out such advantages as may get the better of the objections to its [being on] the North side. However you must finally decide on view [of the] whole. As to the kind of Fortification I imagine you proposed in the first Place to build a Stockade for temporary Purposes. The Post is so important really as to merit Works of the best Kind, but on this it would be necessary to consult the Legislature who would be to provide for the Expence. In the mean Time I imagine you will think it well first to plan and lay off the good works you would propose, and then build your temporary Fort so as to encompass them and protect those who should be working on them, or, if this would be too large to be manned by your Force, the temporary Work might be built within the Lines laid off for the good. When you shall have determined on your spot we should be glad to receive a minute description of it with a plan of the good works you would [pr]opose to erect not meaning however thereby to suspend the temporary works.\nI am Sir Your very humble servt.,\nTh:Jefferson"

Your Excellency may remember that I waited on you here in April 1786 and showed you the Virginia Gazette No. 349 dated 14 Jany. 1773 wherein Genl. Washington Advertises all the Officers and Soldiers that Served the Campagne of 1754 and their representatives that there Proportion of Land is laid out for them. My share is on the Kanhawa River near the Ohio, and I always paid my proportion of Every expence by my Attorney Mr. Alexr. Craig of Williamsburg Deceased. Your Excellency will confer a great obligation on me, if you will let me know whether my Lands are Confiscated or not, because if they are not, I will take some steps to have them either improved or Sold; and if I am unfortunate enough to have forfeited them for being a British Subject, for it can be only for that cause, for I was not employed in the war on the Continent, you will oblige me much by informing me of it, that I may have an Opportunity of Applying to the Commissioners appointed by Parliament for such Compensation as may appear to them to be equal to my loss. I am obliged to give in my losses in a few days, and if I have no authority to say that my Lands are Confiscated, I will receive nothing for them.\nI hope your Excellency will excuse this liberty, as its a matter of consequence to me, and I have no other means of obtaining information. If the Lands of all British Subjects who did not join the American Army are forfeited, mine must of Course.\nI have the honor to be with great respect Sir Your Excellency’s Most Obedt & most Humble Servant,\nJno.Polson"

    "content": "ParisNovr. 8. 1795.\nDear Sir\nThe gentn. (Mr Murray) by whom my letters are forwarded was detained longer by contrary winds in Engld. than was expected. I endeavor however to repr. the injury of delay in my other communications by adding to them what intervenes before his departure.\nThe govt. is now completely organised in all its departments, & its effect the happiest that can be conceived upon the publick opinion. What it will be upon publick measures time only will unfold: but as the opinion is formed upon circumstances, wh. grow out of the organization & the apparent tone of each department, it furnishes ground for hope that its effect upon measures will not be less salutary. The division into two branches has given a check to the spirit of faction, which neither reason philosophy nor a regard for publick or personal safety could yeild. In the House of Antients you see the members sitting like those in the Senates of our respective States, quiet & without any think [sic] to do: Whilst the messengers of State keep a vigilant eye upon every Spectator, & if the slightest indecency passes, or disrespect is shewn, by wearing a hat or otherwise by any one it is immediately notic’d & corrected. As this was the chamber of the late Convention where a different style was observed the difference strikes the Spectators with amazement. And inthe other house the contrast is almost as great, for the manner of debate is more formal & tranquil, & the delay in passing laws much greater, whereby more time will be given for reflection and the laws themselves be wiser of course.\nReubell, Lariveillére Lepeaux, Barras, Latourneur & Carnot are in the Directoire. Sieyes was appointed but declined as he likewise did afterwards the office of foreign affrs. The ministers are in general wise men & sound to the revolution. Merlin de Douai is minister of justice wh. means Home Department. Truguet of Marine, LaCroix of foreign affrs. Benezeck of the interior, wh. means publick arsenals, founderies, &ca &ca. The minister of finance is said to be an able man in that line—his name I forget.\nI find by theking of England’s speech that the president has ratified the treaty. This is the only intelligence I have of it. If theadministration had tried to get better terms it might—but to have done so would have condemned what was already done. If you mean to do anything you should call for my correspondence and publish it. It will be objected to as indelicate to me but do not regard this. Unless it beseen some things will never be knownwhich cod. not fail to produce an important effect.I should be attackedbut I think notinjured and the publick essentially benefited. Be assuredI am not anxious about my place and think the most use possible should be made of me for the publick good. To evade it all kind of tricks & artifices will be practiced, but these it is to be presumed will not succeed.To read a dispatch of the French minister handed by the British was not right but to be the dupe of that trick was worse let the merit of the poor victimbe what it may.I think P. has succeeded in Spain in some way or other whereby the Missisipi will be opened.This I infer fromhis letters to me he was certainly duped by Jaytho’a sensible and worthy man. If you do not shake this party off its caprices will hereafter pass for wisdom and the virtuous efforts of the patriots for turbulence—but you are on the ground and know best what to do.\nYour furniture, consisting of a bed of crimson damask, bedstead & mattrasses, 2. carpets & curtains for six windows have been forwarded hence sometime since for Havre. They will probably sail with this. Yr. china will soon be forwarded. I beg of you to send me a list of whatever you want, in furniture books &ca leaving it to me to procure & send them as I find convenient. At leasure I shall make better bargains & especially as I shall buy for you when I buy for myself."

The Decree inthe Aurora No. 220, is the most unjust Decree that ever was given—because the French Prize Act, as well as the Letters of Marque, declares that all vessels found with such Documents as those had, named in the said Decree, shall be considered and declared as Pirates.\n“They were both fitted out, armed and manned in this Port; and are actually owned by persons residing here. I have again protested against this Decree; but if I shou’d not succeed, I shall receive the property and give the required security for the amount, and send it forward to the United States; thereto be disposed of to the best advantage for the benefit of those interested and hope that the owners will without delay take the necessary steps at the different Tribunals to which the parties have appealed, to save their property.\n“I will procure the proceedings of this Tribunal and Transmit them to your Department without delay, in order that the parties interested may there be informed what steps they ought to take, for the recovery of their property.\n“I shall have in the course of a few Days, the Original Letter of General Brunet who commanded at Auxcayes, on the subject of the surrender of that place to the British—and who appears to have granted many Commissions or Letters of Marque—and from the best information that I can get, some is dated 17 Days after he was a prisoner of War; as will more fully appear from one granted to the Eliza No. 21.\n“I am sorry to have it in my power to inform you that the Brig Minerva of Newbury Port, William Greene late Master, has been captured and brought into this Port by a Spanish Merchantman; in consequence of her having been found with but three men on board: from which circumstance it was supposed that the crew had murdered their officers. I have seen the three men; and shall after I see the papers of the vessel (which I am informed were found on board), take the necessary steps to release her—as well as the three men; provided nothing Criml. appears agt. them, except the recapturing of their vessel from a French Cruizer, that had captured her a few days before.\n“They state that they were captured on the 21st. of April in the Coucos passage, while on their voyage from Port Auprince to NewburyPort, by a schooner under French Colors; the Commander of which, took out the Captain and rest of the crew, and sent her for a Port—but that soon afterwards, the Island of Cuba in sight, finding a favorable opportunity they rose upon the Frenchmen, 14 in Number, subdued them and put them all bound into the Boat except one, and set the Boat a drift—And that after the expiration of two days, they fell in with the Spanish Brig aforesaid, the commander of which, instead of affording them succor, captured the vessel, confined and treated them in the most brutal manner while on board and delivered them up and had them put into the Common Prison, on their arrival here.\n“I also send you enclosed the original list of American vessels captured and carried into St. Jago de Cuba—up to the 2d. of March—a copy of which I before sent to you [not found].\n“In No. 220. you will find some Remarks of Baron Humboldt, who I lately recommended to your attention and protection; these can not be otherwise than interesting at this moment; particularly as he is now on his route to the city of Washington, and will have it in his power to give you much useful information relativeto the country adjoining Louisiana.” Adds in a postscript: “Also Protest of Fras. Lewis.”"

In the first place I would wish to convey to you my thanks for the honor which you conferred upon me in the Appointment as Consul of the United States forDemeraryandEssequiboand tho’ not accepted as such by the Government of those Colonies I shall ever hold it as a mark of your Confidence in my Abilities and integrity, which, while it is flattering to my feelings, claims the Tribute of my unfeign’d Gratitude.—On my Arrival at these Colonies I immediately waited upon Mr. Rousselet, our late Consul, to whomI was handsomely recommendedby Mr. Gallatin. Mr. Rousselet informed me that he had never been accepted by the Government as Consul, nor had his predecessor Mr. Brush of New York, and as there appear’d to be no probability that the Government wou’d accept a Consul from this Country he had some time sincetransmitted to America his Resignation, which was accepted by the President of the United States.I wrote several Letterswhile in those Colonies to the Secretary of State informing him of these things and stating to him the Nature of the Trade between the Dutch Colonies on the Coast of Guiana and the United States of America. Tho’ not acting officially, yet in my individual Capacity I was the means of rescuing several Americans from an Impressment on Board English and Dutch Ships and considering the mortality which raged on Board those vessels in all probability was likewise the means of saving some of their Lives.\nMy Expenses in going to Demerary, residing there and returning to America were much more than my pecuniary Resourses could well support and have reduced my Circumstances to a low Ebb.—I believe that I have before mentioned to you that I have been in thePublicEmploymentnear Eight Years as a Clerk, two Years of which were with Joseph Nourse Esqr. Register of the Treasury in his own Room and as his Confidential Clerk. To that Gentleman, I with Confidence beg leave to refer you for information respecting me. I left the Treasury Department to accept an appointment in the Bank of Pennsylvania of 200 Dollars ⅌. Annum more than I received in the Treasury. A short time after I Entered the Bank of Pennsylvania I resign’d that situation and went to Europe. On my Return from Europe I again received an Appointment in the Treasury Department, where I continued untill thatEvent took placeof which I have already informed you, as likewise the motives which led thereto. I wrote to Richard Harrison Esqr: Auditor of the Treasury to return me the Recommendations which I deposited with him; in Reply, he informed me, that they were all consumed byFire in the Treasury Department. I have others, however, equally strong from public Bodies and public Characters in Philadelphia. My Exertions, however feeble, have always been used in support of the Principles of Republicanism and I can safely declare that those Exertions and the open Avowal of my political principles have been the Cause of considerable personal Loss and Embarrasment to me. I beg leave to observe to you, that it was never my intention to have made another application for Employment, but my necessities at this Time strongly urge me to the Measure and I indulge the hope that you will excuse the Liberty I have taken. I cou’d wish Sir, in case there are any Vacancies in that Line, a pursership on Board one of the Frigates, or some place in New Orleans which would yield me a Livlihood. The best Recommendation shall be furnish’d and so far as regards myself no personal Exertion and Attention shall be wanting in discharge of the Duties.\nI beg leave to enclose a Copy of my Letter to Mr. Rousselet, late Consul at Demerary, together with his Answer, by which you will find that he mentions his having sent his Resignation to the Executive and that it was accepted. He told me further, that he informd the Secretary of State, that no Consul wou’d be received in Demerary, a Circumstance which I was not informed of previous to my leaving America.—Mr: Rousselet strove all in his power to injure me in the Estimation of the Governor of those Colonies and not only myself but the present Administration of the United States, by sending to the Governor those News papers which contain’d the most infamous Abuse agt Republicans. When call’d upon for explanation he denied it was with that intent. Mr. Rousselet is not a Citizen of the United States and in other Respects I assure you Sir, is but ill calculated to watch over the interests of our Citizens. The Duty I owe to my Countryinduces me to mention these things in Regard to Mr. Rousselet, as I understandhe has made applicationfor a Consulship in some one of the ports of France.—With the highest Respect and Esteem,\nI have the Honor to be Sir, Your most obedt: & most hb: Sert:\nWm. P.Gardner"

You saw in the public papers a report of a committee, erroneously said to be an act of Congress, for dividing the Western country into new states.

Month 1802.\nRespected Friend,\nIt was with a high degree of satisfaction, I observed in a letter I lately received from my friend Dr. Saml L. Mitchill of New York, the following paragraph:—”In consequence of a suggestion of the President of the United States, I had previously written to Mr. L’Hommedieu an account of the Project of attempting to mature a National Agricultural Society. I hope these communications will have their effect and dispose the friends of Agriculture in the different States to cultivate intercourse with each other;—and eventually to mature a plan upon a scale equal to the importance of the subject in which they are engaged.”\nSince the receipt of Dr. Mitchill’s letter thePresident of the Farmers’ Societyin this neighbourhood has received acircular communicationfrom the Society instituted for the promotion of Agriculture, Arts, and Manufactures in New York, inviting us and other similar societies to concur with them in appointing delegates to meet at the seat of Congress during their session.\nThe pleasure I derive from a knowledge of these events receives no small augmentation from a recollection of the correspondence which I assumed the liberty of commencing with thee.\nIf I use greater freedom than becomes the extreme difference of our spheres in society, I must draw my excuse from thy own facility of access, and inviting affability, which have encouraged me to proceed; in addition to the pleasure I have always enjoyed in intercourse with men of science.\nThere is no doubt but our society will concur in the plan proposed by that of New York—We shall then want some members, resident in the City of Washington, delegated to meet in theNational Society, on our behalf. I have already, by his permission, proposed Secretary Madison, as anHonorary member—his name will be submitted to ballot, at our next meeting, on the 8th. day of next month.\nThe principal object of this letter is to solicit permission to propose thy name also.—Our meetings are quarter-yearly, and a candidate cannot be elected at the meeting in which he is proposed. May I expect information on this point previously to our next meeting? The mail for Brookeville, is closed in Washington, in the evening, I believe, of the third day of each week.\nWhat is the President’s opinion ofThomas Moore’s performance?—It is hisfirstas an Author.\nI am, with much respect, Thy friend,\nIsaac Briggs."

    "content": "Head Qrs Tappan [N.Y.] Augt 13th 1780\nDear Sir,\nThe subject of this letter will be confined to a single point. I shall make it as short as possible, & write it with frankness. If any sentiment therefore is delivered which might be displeasing to youas a member ofCongress, ascribe it to the freedom which is taken with you by a friend, who has nothg in view but the public good.\nIn your letter without date, but which came to hand yesterday, an idea is held up as if the acceptance of General Green’s resignation of the Qr Mrs department was not all that Congress meant to do with him —If by this it is in contemplation to suspend him from his command in the line (of which he made an express reservation at the time of entering on the other duty) and it is not already enacted, let me beseech you to considerwellwhat you are about before you resolve.\nI shall neither condemn, nor acquit Genl Greens conduct for the act of resignation, because all the antecedent correspondences are necessary to form a right judgment of the matter; and possibly if the affair is ever brought before the public—you may find him treading on better ground than you seem to imagine; but this by the by. My sole aim at present, is to advertise you of what I think would be the consequences of suspending him from his command in the line (—a matter distinct from the other)—without a proper tryal. A proceedure of this kind must touch the feelings of every Officer—it will shew in a conspicuous point of view the uncertain tenure by which they hold their Commissions—In a word it will exhibit such a specimen of power that I question much if there is an Officer in the whole line that will hold a Commission beyond the end of the Campaign if they do ’till then. Such an Act in the most Despotic Government would be attended at least with loud complaints.\nIt does not require I am sure with You argument at this time of day to prove, that there is no set of Men in the United States (considered as a body) that have made the same sacrafices of their Interest in support of the common cause as the Officers of the American Army—that nothing but a love of their Country—of honor, & a desire of seeing their labours crowned with success could possibly induce them to continue one moment in Service—That no Officer can live upon his pay, that hundreds having spent their little all in addition to their scant public allowance have resigned, because they could no longer support themselves as officers—that numbers are, at this moment, rendered unfit for duty for want of Cloathing, while the rest are wasteing their property & some of them verging fast to the gulph of poverty & distress. Can it be supposed that Men under these circumstances who can derive at best if the Contest ends happily only the advantages which attend in equal proportion with Others will sit patient under such a precedent? Surely they will not, for the measure, not the man, will be the subject of considerat⟨ion⟩ & each will ask himself this question if Congress by its mere fiat, without enquiry & without tryal, will suspend one Officer today an officer of such high rank—may it not be my turn tomorrow &ought I to put it in the power of any Man or body of Men to sport with my Commission & character & lay me under the necessity of tamely acquiescing, or by an appeal to the public expose matters which must be injurious to its interests?\nThe suspension of Genls Schuyler & St Clair, tho it was preceded by the loss of Ticonderoga which contributed not a little for the moment to excite prejudices against them, was by no means viewed with a satisfactory eye by many discerning Men, and tho it was in a manner supported by the public clamor; and the one in contemplation I am almost morally certain will be generally reprobated by the Army. Suffer not my Friend, If it is within the compass of your abilities to prevent it, so disagreable an event to take place. I do not mean to justify—to countenance or excuse in the most distant degree any expressions of disre[s]pect—which the Gentn in Question, if he has used any, may have offererd to Congress, no more than I do any unreasonable matters he may have required respecting the Q.M. Gs department, but as I have already observed, My Letter is to prevent his suspension, becauseI fear—becauseI feelit must lead to very disagreable & injurious consequences. Genl Greene has his numerous Friends out of the Army as well as in it—and from his Character & consideration in the World, he might not, when he felt himself wounded, in so summary way, withold from a discussion that could not at best promote the public cause. As a Military Officer he stands very fair and very deservedly so, in the Opinion of all his acquaintance.\nThese sentiments are the result of my own reflexions on the matter & I hasten to inform you of them. I do not know that Genl Greene has ever heard of the matter and I hope he never may—nor am I acquainted with the opinion of a single Officer in the whole Army upon the subject nor will any tone be given by me—It is my wish to prevent the proceeding for sure I am it cannot be brought to a happy issue if it takes place. I am &\nGo: W——n"

I know not how to neglect so fair an Opportunity of Writing, convinced that a Line from your Friend will be acceptable, if it be only to inform you that we have an Existence in America as an indepen[den]t Nation, that our Commonwealth lives, that our annual Election is Compleated, the Legislative and executive Bodies organized, That our Families and Connections are well and that the Season is truly promising having been blessed with frequent Rains. Our Crops of Grass will be great and the English Grain has a fine Aspect. Great Quantities of the Syberian wheat have been sown this year throughout the State. Hitherto it has succeeded and no blast has happened to it, since its first Introduction in the Country, it is about Six years since any of this Grain was heard of here—a few Quarts was in the Hands of [blank inMS] in Portsmouth—last year some Farmers raised 2 or 300 Bushells.\nThe Scituation of our public Affairs is not at present so favourable as I could wish for. For want of naval Assistance, the Enemy have gaind many Advantages, they have bent all their Force to the Southward, have established Posts at Virginia, North Carolina &c. and are ravaging the Southern States. They have met with many severe Checks, have lost many Men and the Army at South Carolina under Gen. Cornwallis is supposed to be lessened one half—by Battles, Sick­ness, Desertion &c. Gen. Green has opposed the Enemy with a very inferior Force and under the greatest Embarassments has kept a Body sufficient to prevent the Conquest of those Countries, he has performed Wonders.—The Depreciation of our Paper Currency has been the fatal Source of almost all the Misfortunes We have suffered for several years past. Our Enemies are continually availing themselves of every Advantage that can be obtaind from a fluctuating Currency. They have but too well succeded in their Plans. A late Shock We have sustained, by a sudden Depreciation of the old continental Emission from 75 to 200, 250 and even 300—in one Week it fell from 75 to 150. I flatter myself that this will in the End rather serve than disserve us. It has pretty generally convinced People that We must not any longer depend on a paper Medium, and such Measures are now pursuing and will I hope be carried into effect, as will enable us to conduct our affairs with Stability. It was necessary that we should be severely whipd and a whipping we have had, such as is sensibly felt and will leave a lasting impression. It will purify our Minds, open our Faculties and lead us to guard against those Evils, which must have proved our Ruin if persisted in.\nThis Morning a Report prevails that the French Fleet and Army under the Command of [blank inMS] have retaken St. Lucia. I think there is a great Probability of it. We have had Advice some Days agone, that on the arrival of this Fleet in the West Indies, Rodney was before Martinico, who upon their Appearance, left his Station, attacked the French, found his Fleet unable to cope with the French and ran. The French pursued and cut him off from St. Lucia, took that Opportunity of Landing 4 or 5000 Troops and laid Seige to it."

From these I have received Letters and Tokens of approbation and Friendship in a style of ardour, Zeal, and exultation similar to yours.\nYour Postscript is a Morsel of exquisite Beauty and utility. My life will undoubtedly depend in a great Measure on my observance of it—\nThe Labour of my office is very constant and very severe, and before this time you will have seen enough to convince, that my Prospects as well as yours are grave; I should be much obliged to you for your sentiments and those of the people in general about you concerning what ought to be done.—\nI am Sir with sincere esteem your / Friend and Servant,\nJohn Adams—"

I do this the more readily, upon the possible supposition, that you may not receive, from a more authentic source, more satisfactory intelligence of the dispositions & real wishes of the Convention & people of West Florida—a country & people who will become perhaps, a subject of very interesting & important deliberation with the executive.\nMr. Barrow has been induced to give me these details of the state of his country and the people, I apprehend, by considerations of the strongest personal regard and to gratify an high degree of interest, that he correctly supposed to actuate me, by reason of much local & personal acquaintance, acquired during a very leisure tour through that country & the adjoining Territories two years ago—but, as he alledges, to obtain the benefits of my opinions & advice, which, I know he values greatly above their intrinsic worth.\nTo foster his friendly confidence, and to invite a continuance of his full & frank communications upon the political occurrences of his country, I replied from time to time, with perfect freedom & sincerity of thought—expressing views of the political situation of his country, and the measures, it would therefore be incumbent to adopt & persue with steady energy—enforcing the doctrine, that the integrity of their interests was essentiallylinked with that of the U. States—suggesting & elucidating the impolicy of an alliance with the other Spanish American provinces—warning him with strong emphasis, against the fatal security of an unsuspecting confidence in the fidelity of their Gove[r]nor & many others, whose greater immediate benefits would prompt opposition to any measures of a revolutionary tendency, and which would necessarily be secret & insidious—and therefore urging, as the best measure of self prese[r]vation, to assume the rights of self government upon popular principles. In all which, it gives me some satisfaction, to find my views were not so incorrect as to mislead; nor my predictions not far short of being amply verified, except in the measure of absolute revolution, which is yet in the progress of experiment.\nUnder every circumstance & my knowledge of Mr. Barrow, I cannot withold entire confidence in the honesty & correctness of all his communications. In the two inclosed copies, you will remark a difference in their tenor, but an emphatic concordance in the views intimated in the first, with the actual events of the 22d. Septr., stated in the second.\nI have not thought it worth while to communicate any thing upon this Subject derived through this channel, to any one, but Gove[r]nor Blount, save, yourself: and to him, because in several conversations last summer, he manifested so lively an interest in every thing relating to our South Western Frontier; and especially, as far as it might be involved in the fate of West Florida.\nIf herein, I have been unseasonably intrusive, please, do me the justice to counterballance the inconvenience thereof, by the misapplied good will, that led to my unprofitable communications. I am with perfect good wishes & entire Respect your Obt. Sevt.\nJ. R. Bedford"

I am obliged too to Mr. Hall for enabling you on a Pinch to buy it. But I am sorry you had somuch Trouble about it; and the more so, as it seems to have occasioned some Disgust in you against Messrs. Foxcrofts for not supplying you with Money to pay for it. That you may not be offended with your Neighbours without Cause, I must acquaint you with what it seems you did not know, that I had limited them in their Payments to you, to the Sum of Thirty Pounds per Month, for the sake of our more easily settling, and to prevent Mistakes. This making 360 Pounds a Year, I thought, as you have no House Rent to pay yourself, and receive the Rents of 7 or 8 Houses besides, might be sufficient for the Maintenance of your Family. I judged such a Limitation the more necessary, because you never have sent me any Account of your Expences, and think yourself ill-used if I desire it; and because I know you were not very attentive to Money-matters in your best Days, and I apprehend that your Memory is too much impair’d for the Management of unlimited Sums, without Danger of injuring the future Fortune of your Daughter and Grandson. If out of more than £500 a Year, you could have sav’d enough to buy those Bills it might have been well to continue purchasing them: But I do not like your going about among my Friends to borrow Money for that purpose, especially as it is not at all necessary. And therefore I once more request that you would decline buying them for the future. And I hope you will no longer take it amiss of Messrs. Foxcrofts that they did not supply you. If what you receive is really insufficient for your Support, satisfy me by Accounts that it is so, and I shall order more.\nI am much pleased with the little Histories you give me of your fine Boy, which are confirm’d by all that have seen him. I hope he will be spared, and continue the same Pleasure and Comfort to you, and that I shall ere long partake with you in it. My Love to him, and to his Papa and Mama. Mrs. Stevenson too is just made very happy by her Daughter’s being safely delivered of a Son: the Mother and Child both well.

    "content": "Wmsburg July 17th 1779\nSir\nI some time ago inclosed to you a printed copy of an Order of Council, by which Governor Hamilton was to be confined in Irons in close Jail. This has occasioned a letter from General Philips of which the inclosed is a Copy. The General seems to suppose that a prisoner on capitulation cannot be put into close confinement tho his capitulation shall not have provided against it. My idea was that all persons taken in war were to be deemed prisoners of war. That those who surrender on capitulation (or convention) are prisoners of war also subject to the same treatment with those who surrender at discretion, except only so far as the terms of their capitulation or convention shall have guarded them. In the Capitulation of Governor Hamilton (a Copy of which I inclose) no stipulation is made as to the treatment of himself or those taken with him. The Governor indeed when he signs, adds a flourish of reasons inducing him to capitulate, one of which is the generosity of his Enemy. Generosity on a large and comprehensive Scale seems to dictate the making a signal example of this gentleman; but waiving that, these are only the private motives inducing him tosurrender, and do not enter into the Contract of Colonel Clarke. I have the highest idea of the sacredness of those Contracts which take place between nation and nation at war, and would be among the last on earth who should do any thing in violation of them. I can find nothing in those Books usually recurred to as testimonials of the Laws and usages of nature and nations which convicts the opinions, I have above expressed, of error. Yet there may be such an usage as General Philips seems to suppose, tho’ not taken notice of by these writers. I am obliged to trouble your Excellency on this occasion by asking of you information on this point. There is no other person whose decision will so authoritatively decide this doubt in the public mind and none with which I am disposed so implicitly to comply. If you shall be of opinion that the bare existence of a Capitulation in the case of Governor Hamilton privileges him from confinement, tho there be no article to that effect in the capitulation, justice shall most assuredly be done him. The importance of this question in a public view, and my own anxiety under a charge of a violation of national faith by the Executive of this Commonwealth will I hope apologize for my adding this to the many, many troubles with which I know you to be burthened. I have the honor to be with the most profound respect & esteem Yr. Excellency’s mo: obedt. & mo: hble. servt.,\nTh:Jefferson\nP.S. I have just receiveda Letter from Colo. Blandcontaining information of numerousdesertions from the Convention Troops(not less than 400 in the last fortnight). He thinks he has reason to believe it is with the connivance of some of their officers. Some of these have been retaken, all of them going northwardly. They had armed themselves with forged passports, and with Certificates of having taken the oath of fidelity to the State, some of them forged, others really given by weak Magistrates. I mention this to your Excellency as perhaps it may be in your power to have such of them intercepted as shall be passing through Pennsylvania and Jersey.\nYour letter inclosing the opinion of the board of officers in the case between Allison and Lee is come safe to hand after a long passage. It shall be answered by next post. TH: J."

Binn’s success has stopped that emigration. it is now becoming[one]of the most productive counties of the state of Virginia, and the price given for th[ose] lands is multiplied manifold.\nWe are still uninformed here whether you are again at war. Buonaparte has produced such a state of things in Europe as it would seem difficult for him to relinquish in any sensible degree, and equally dangerous for Great Britain to suffer to go on, especially if accompanied by maritime preparations, on his part. the events which have taken place in France have lessened in the American mind the motives of interest which it felt in that revolution, and it’s amity towards that country now rests on it’s love of peace & commerce. we see at the same time with great concern the position in which Great Britain is placed, and should be sincerely afflicted were any disaster to deprive mankind of the benefit of such abulwark againstthetorrentwhich has for some time been bearing down all before it. but her power & prowess [by] sea seem to render every thing safe in the end. peace is our passion, & tho’ wrongs might drive us from it, we prefer trying every other just principle [of] right & safety before we would recur to war.\nI hope your agricultural institution goes on with success. I consider you as the author of all the good it shall do. a better idea has never been carried into practice.our Agricultural societyhas at lengthformed itself. like our American Philosophical society it is voluntary, & unconnected with the public, and is precisely an execution of the plan I formerly sketched to you. some state societies have been formed heretofore. the others will do the same. each state society names two of it’s members of Congress to be their members in the Central society, which is of course together during the sessions of Congress. they are to select matter from the proceedings of the state societies & to publish it, so that their publications may be called l’esprit des societés d’agriculture &c. the central society was formed the last winter only so that it will be some time before they get under way. mr Madison, the Secretary of state was elected their President.\nRecollecting with great satisfactionour friendly intercoursewhile I was in Europe, I nourish the hope it still preserves a place in your mind, and with my salutations I pray you to accept assurances of my constant attachment and high respect.\nTh: Jefferson"

    "content": "Mch.–May 1784\nNotes on the establishment of a Money Unit, and of a Coinage for the United States.\nIn fixing the Unit of money, these circumstances are of principal importance.\nI. That it be ofconvenient sizeto be applied as a measure to the common money transactions of life.\nII. That it’s parts and multiples be in an easy proportionto each other, so as to facilitate the money arithmetic.\nIII. That the Unit and it’s parts, or divisions beso nearly of the value of some of the known coinsas that they may be of easy adoption for the people.\nThe Spanish Dollar seems to fulfil all these conditions.\nI. Taking into our view all money transactions, great and small, I question if a common measure of moreconvenient sizethan the Dollar could be proposed. The value of 100, 1000, 10,000 dollars is well estimated by the mind. So is that of the tenth or the hundredth of a dollar. Few transactions are above or below these limits. The expediency of attending to the size of the Money Unit will be evident to any one who will consider how inconvenient it would be to a manufacturer or merchant, if, instead of the yard for measuring cloth, either the inch or the mile had been made the Unit of measure.\nII. The mosteasy ratioof multiplication and division is that by ten. Every one knows the facility of Decimal Arithmetic. Every one remembers, that, when learning money arithmetic, he used to be puzzled with adding the farthings, taking out the fours and carrying them on; adding the pence, taking out the twelves and carrying them on; adding the shillings, taking out the twenties and carrying them on. But when he came to the pounds, where he had only tens to carry forward, it was easy and free from error. The bulk of mankind are school boys thro’ life. These little perplexities are always great to them. And even Mathematical heads feel the relief of an easier substituted for a more difficult process. Foreigners too who trade or travel among us will find a great facility in understanding our coins and accounts from this ratio of subdivision. Those who have had occasion to convert the Livres, sols and deniers of the French, the Gilders, stivers, and penings of the Dutch, the Pounds, shillings, pence and farthings of these several states into each other can judge how much they would have been aided had their several subdivisions been in a decimal ratio. Certainly in all cases where we are free to chuse between easy and difficult modes of operation, it is most rational to chuse the easy. The Financier therefore in his report, well proposes that our Coins should be in decimal proportions to one another. If we adopt the Dollar for our Unit, we should strike four coins, one of gold, two of silver, and one of copper, viz.\nCompare the Arithmetical operations on the same sum of money expressed in this form, and expressed in the pound sterling and it’s divisions.\nAddition.

The same difference arises in making paiment. An Englishman to pay £8–13s–11d ½qrs. must find by calculation what combination of the coins of his country will pay this sum. But an American, having the same sum to pay, thus expressed 38.D.65 will know by inspection only that 3. golden peices, 8 units or Dollars, 6 tenths and 5 coppers pay it precisely.\nIII. The third condition required is that the Unit, it’s multiples, and subdivisions coincide in value with some of the known coins so nearly, that the people may, by a quick reference in the mind, estimate their value. If this be not attended to, they will be very long in adopting the innovation, if ever they adopt it. Let us examine in this point of view each of the 4. coins proposed.\n1.The Golden peice will be ⅕ more than a half Joe, and 1/15 more than a double guinea. It will be readily estimated then by reference to either of them; but more readily and accurately as equal to 10. dollars.\n2.The Unit or Dollar is a known coin, and the most familiar of all to the minds of the people. It is already adopted from South to North; has identified our currency, and therefore happily offers itself as an Unit already introduced. Our public debt, our requisitions, and their apportionments have given it actual and long possession of the place of Unit. The course of our commerce toowill bring us more of this than of any other foreign coin, and therefore renders it more worthy of attention. I know of no Unit which can be proposed in competition with the Dollar, but the Pound. But what is the Pound? 1547. grains of fine silver in Georgia; 1289. grains in Virginia, Connecticut, Rhode island, Massachusets, and New Hampshire; 1031 ¼ grains in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey; 966 ¾ grains in North Carolina and New York. Which of these shall we adopt? To which state give that preeminence of which all are so jealous? And on which impose the difficulties of a new estimate for their corn, their cattle and other commodities? Or shall we hang the pound sterling, as a common badge, about all their necks? This contains 1718 ¾ grains of pure silver. It is difficult to familiarize a new coin to the people. It is more difficult to familiarize them to a new coin with an old name. Happily the Dollar is familiar to them all; and is already as much referred to for a measure of value as their respective provincial pounds.\n3. The Tenth will be precisely the Spanish Bit, or half pistereen. This is a coin perfectly familiar to us all. When we shall make a new coin then equal in value to this, it will be of ready estimate with the people.\n4. The Hundredth, or Copper, will differ little from the copper of the 4. Eastern states which is 1/108 of a dollar; still less from the penny of New York and N. Carolina which is 1/96 of a dollar: and somewhat more from the penny or Copper of Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland which is 1/90 of a Dollar. It will be about the medium between the old and the new coppers of these states, and therefore will soon be substituted for them both. In Virginia coppers have never been in use. It will be as easy therefore to introduce them there of one value as of another. The Copper coin proposed will be nearly equal to three fourths of their penny, which is the same with the penny lawful of the Eastern states.\nA great deal of small change is useful in a state, and tends to reduce the prices of small articles. Perhaps it would not be amiss to coin three more peices of silver, one of the value of five tenths, or half a dollar, one of the value of two Tenths which would be equal to the Spanish pistereen, and one of the value of 5. Coppers, which would be equal to the Spanish halfbit. We should then have five silver coins, viz.\nThe plan reported by the Financier is worthy of his sound judgment. It admits however of objection in the size of the Unit. He proposes that this shall be the 1440th. part of a Dollar: so that it will require 1440. of his units to make the one before proposed. He was led to adopt this by a mathematical attention to our old currencies all of which this Unit will measure without leaving a fraction. But as our object is to get rid of those currencies the advantage derived from this coincidence will soon be past, whereas the inconveniencies of this Unit will for ever remain, if they do not altogether prevent it’s introduction. It is defective in two of the three requisites of a Money unit. 1. It is inconvenient in it’s application to the ordinary money transactions. 10,000 dollars will require 8. figures to express them, to wit, 14,400,000 Units. A horse or bullock of 80. dollars value will require a notation of six figures, to wit, 115,200 Units. As a money of account this will be laborious, even when facilitated by the aid of decimal arithmetic: as a common measure of the value of property it will be too minute to be comprehended by the people. The French are subjected to very laborious calculations, the Livre being their ordinary money of account, and this but between ⅕ and ⅙ of a dollar. But what will be our labours, should our money of account be 1/1440th of a Dollar only?\n2. It is neither equal, nor near to, any of the known coins in value.\nIf we determine that a Dollar shall be our Unit, we must then say with precision what a Dollar is. This coin, as struck at different times, of different weights and fineness, is of different values. Sr. Isaac Newton’s assay and representation to the Lords of the Treasury in 1717 of those which he examined, make their values as follows.\nThe Financier states the old dollar as containing 376. grains of fine silver, and the new 365 grains. If the dollars circulating among us be of every date equally, we should examine the quantity of pure metal in each and from them form an average for our Unit. This is a work proper to be committed to Mathematicians as well as Merchants, and which should be decided on actual and accurate experiment.\nThe quantum of alloy is also to be decided. Some is necessary to prevent the coin from wearing too fast. Too much fills our pockets with copper instead of silver. The silver coins assayed by Sr. Isaac Newton varied from 1 ½ to 76 pennyweight alloy in the pound Troy of mixed metal. The British standard has 18. dwt. The Spanish coins assayed by Sr. Isaac Newton have from 18. to 19 ½ dwt., the new French crown has in fact 19 ½, tho’ by edict it should have 20 dwt. that is 1/12. The taste of our countrymen will require that their furniture plate should be as good as the British standard. Taste cannot be controuled by law. Let it then give the law in a point which is indifferent to a certain degree. Let the legislatures fix the alloy of furniture plate at 18. dwt. the British standard and Congress that of their coin at one ounce in the pound, the French standard. This proportion has been found convenient for the alloy of gold coin, and it will simplify the system of our mint to alloy both metals in the same degree. The coin too being the least pure, will be less easily melted into plate. These reasons are light indeed, and of course will only weigh if no heavier ones can be opposed to them.\nThe proportion between the values of gold and silver is a mercantile problem altogether. It would be inaccurate to fix it by the popular exchanges of a half Joe for eight dollars, a Louis for 4. French crowns, or 5. Louis for 23. Dollars. The first of these would be to adopt the Spanish proportion between gold and silver; the second the French; the third a mere popular barter, wherein convenience is consulted more than accuracy. The legal proportion in Spain is 16. for 1. in England 15 ⅕ for 1. in France 15. for 1. The Spaniards and English are found in experience to retain an overproportion of gold coins and to lose their silver. The French have a greater proportion of silver. The difference at market has been on the decrease. The Financier states it at present as at 14 ½ for 1. Just principles will lead us to disregard legal proportions altogether; to enquire into the market price of gold in the several countries with which we shall principally be connected in commerce, and to take an average from them. Perhaps we might withsafety lean to a proportion somewhat above par for gold, considering our neighborhood and commerce with the sources of the coins, and the tendency which the high price of gold in Spain has to draw thither all that of their mines, leaving silver principally for our, and other markets. It is not impossible that 15. for 1. may be found an eligible proportion. I state it however as conjectural only.\nAs to the alloy for gold coin, the British is an ounce in the pound; the French, Spanish and Portuguese differ from that only from a quarter of a grain to a grain and a half. I should therefore prefer the British, merely because it’s fraction stands in a more simple form, and facilitates the calculations into which it enters.\nShould the Unit be fixed at 365 grains of pure silver, gold at 15. for 1. and the alloy of both be one twelfth, the weights of the coins will be as follows.\nThe quantity of fine silver which shall constitute the Unit being settled, and the proportion of the value of gold to that of silver; a table should be formed from the assay before suggested, classing the several foreign coins according to their fineness, declaring the worth of a pennyweight or grain in each class, and that they shall be lawful tenders at those rates, if not clipped or otherwise diminished; and where diminished offering their value for them at the mint, deducting the expence of recoinage. Here the legislatures should cooperate with Congress in providing that no money be received or paid at their treasuries, or by any of their officers, or any bank but on actual weight; in making it criminal in a high degree to diminish their own coins, and in some smaller degree to offer them in paiment when diminished.\nThat this subject may be properly prepared and in readiness for Congress to take up at their meeting in November, something must now be done. The present session drawing to a close they probably would not chuse to enter far into this undertaking themselves. The Committee of the states however, during the recesswill have time to digest it thoroughly, if Congress will fix some general principles for their government. Suppose then they be instructed\nTo appoint proper persons to assay and examine, with the utmost accuracy practicable, the Spanish milled dollars of different dates in circulation with us.\nTo assay and examine in like manner the fineness of all other the coins which may be found in circulation within these states.\nTo report to the Committee the result of these assays, by them to be laid before Congress.\nTo appoint also proper persons to enquire what are the proportions between the values of fine gold and fine silver at the markets of the several countries with which we are or probably may be connected in commerce; and what would be a proper proportion here, having regard to the average of their values at those markets and to other circumstances, and to report the same to the Committee by them to be laid before Congress.\nTo prepare an Ordinance for establishing the Unit of money within these states; for subdividing it; and for striking coins of gold, silver, and copper on the following principles.\nThat the Money Unit of these states shall be equal in value to a Spanish milled dollar, containing so much fine silver as the assay before directed shall shew to be contained on an average in dollars of the several dates in circulation with us.\nThat this Unit shall be divided into Tenths and Hundredths:\nThat there shall be a coin of silver of the value of an Unit:\nOne other of the same metal of the value of one Tenth of of an Unit:\nOne other of Copper of the value of the Hundredth of an Unit:\nThat there shall be a coin of Gold of the value of ten Units, according to the report before directed and the judgment of the Committee thereon;\nThat the alloy of the said coins of Gold and Silver shall be equal in weight to one eleventh part of the fine metal.\nThat there be proper devices for these coins:\nThat measures be proposed for preventing their diminution, and also their currency and that of any others when diminished.\nThat the several foreign coins be described and classed in the said Ordinance, the fineness of each class stated, and it’s value by weight estimated in Units and decimal parts of Units.\nAnd that the said draught of an Ordinance be reported toCongress at their next meeting for their consideration and determination.\nSupplementory Explanations\nThe preceding notes having been submitted to the Consideration of the Financier, he favored me with his opinion and observations on them, which render necessary the following supplementory explanations.\nI observed in the preceding notes that the true proportion of value between gold and silver was a mercantile problem altogether and that perhaps 15. for 1. might be found an eligible proportion. The Financier is so good as to inform me that this would be higher than the market would justify. Confident of his better information on this subject, I recede from that idea.\nHe also informs me that the several coins in circulation among us have been already assayed with accuracy, and the result published in a work on that subject. The assay of Sr. Isaac Newton had superseded, in my mind, the necessity of this operation as to the older coins which were the subject of his examination. This later work with equal reason may be considered as saving the same trouble as to the latter.\nSo far then I accede to the opinions of the Financier. On the other hand he seems to concur with me in thinking his smallest fractional division too minute for an unit, and therefore proposes to transfer that denomination to his largest silver coin containing 1000 of the units first proposed, and worth about 4/2 lawful or 25/36 of a dollar. The only question then remaining between us is Whether the Dollar, or this coin, be best for the Unit. We both agree that theease of adoption with the peopleis the thing to be aimed at.\n1. As to the Dollar, events have overtaken and superseded the question. It is no longer a doubt whether the people can adopt it with ease. They have actually adopted it, and will be to be turned out of that into another tract of calculation if another Unit be assumed. They have now two Units, which they use with equal facility, viz. the pound of their respective state, and the dollar. Thefirst of these is peculiar to each state: the second happily common to all. In each state the people have an easy rule for converting the pound of their state into dollars, or dollars into pounds. And this is enough for them without knowing how this may be done in every state of the Union. Such of them as live near enough the borders of their state to have dealings with their neighbors learn also the rule of their neighbors. Thus in Virginia and the Eastern states where the dollar is 6/ or 3/10 of a pound, to turn pounds into dollars they multiply by 10. and divide by 3. to turn dollars into pounds they multiply by 3. and divide by 10. Those in Virginia who live near to Carolina where the dollar is 8/ or 4/10 of a pound learn the operation of that state, which is a multiplication by 4. and division by 10 et e converso. Those who live near Maryland where the dollar is 7/6 or ⅜ of a pound, multiply by 3 and divide by 8, or e converso. All these operations are easy, and have been found by experience not too much for the arithmetic of the people, when they have occasion to convert their old unit into dollars, or the reverse.\n2. As to the Unit of the Financier in the states where the dollar is 3/10 of a pound, this Unit will be 5/24. It’s conversion into the pound then will be by a multiplication by 5 and division by 24. In the states where the dollar is ⅜ of a pound, this unit will be 25/96 of a pound, and the operation must be to multiply by 25 and divide by 96. or e converso. Where the dollar is 4/10 of a pound, this unit will be 5/18. The simplicity of the fraction, and of course the facility of conversion and reconversion, is therefore against this unit, and in favor of the dollar, in every instance. The only advantage it has over the dollar is that it will in every case express our farthings without a remainder; whereas, tho the dollar and it’s decimals will do this in many cases, it will not in all. But, even in these, by extending your notation one figure further, to wit, to thousandths, you approximate to perfect accuracy within less than the two thousandth part of a dollar; an atom in money which every one would neglect. Against this single inconvenience the other advantages of the dollar are more than sufficient to preponderate. This unit will present to the people a new coin, and whether they endeavor to estimate it’s value by comparing it with a pound, or with a dollar, the Units they now possess, they will find the fraction very compound, and of course less accomodated to their comprehension and habits than the dollar. Indeed the probability is that they could never be led to compute in it generally.\nThe Financier supposes that the 1/100 of a dollar is not sufficientlysmall where the poor are purchasers or venders. If it is not, make a smaller coin. But I suspect that it is small enough. Let us examine facts, in countries where we are acquainted with them. In Virginia, where our towns are few, small, and of course their demand for necessaries very limited, we have never yet been able to introduce a copper coin at all. The smallest coin which any body will receive there is the half-bit, or 1/20 of a dollar. In those states where the towns are larger and more populous, a more habitual barter for small wants has called for a copper coin 1/90 or 1/96 or 1/108 of a dollar. In England where the towns are many and populous, and where ages of experience have matured the conveniencies of intercourse, they have found that some wants may be supplied for a farthing, or 1/216 of a dollar, and they have accomodated a coin to this want. This business is evidently progressive. In Virginia we are far behind. In some other states they are farther advanced, to wit to the appreciation of 1/90, 1/96, 1/108 of a dollar. To this most advanced state then I accomodated my smallest coin in the decimal arrangement as amoney of paiment, corresponding with themoney of account. I have no doubt the time will come when a smaller coin will be called for. When it comes, let it be made. It will probably be the half of the copper I propose, that is to say 5/1000 or .005 of a dollar, this being very nearly the farthing of England. But it will be time enough to make it when the people shall be ready to receive it.\nMy proposition then is that our Notation of money shall be decimal, descending ad libitum of the person noting; that the Unit of this notation shall be a dollar, that coins shall be accomodated to it from ten dollars to the hundredth of a dollar; and that to set this on foot, the resolutions be adopted which were proposed in the Notes, only substituting anenquiry into the fineness of the coinsin lieu ofan assayof them.\n*In a newspaper which frequently gives good details in political œconomy I find under the Hamburgh head that the present market price of gold and silver is in England 15.5 for 1; in Russia 15; in Holland 14.75; in Savoy 14.6; in France 14.42; in Spain 14.3; in Germany 14.155; the average of which is 14.675 or 14 ⅝. I would still incline to give a little more than the market price for gold because of it’s superior convenience in transportation. [Ed. Note:—TJ gathered this information in Apr. 1785.

Not that I think the Work would have no other Merit & Use in the World, far from it, but the first is of such vast Importance, that I know nothing that can equal it.\nThe inclosed Letters are of much Importance to our mutual worthy Friend John Strettell & myself as Executors of our deceased Friend Amos Strettell Esqr. decd. as well as his Children &c. which with that directed to Frederick Pigon, I shall be obliged to thee to forward in such Way as will be likely to reach them in Safety & charge the Expence of Postage to me. The Balance resting with thee in Payment of Stringfellow’s Right will serve for such Purpose, at same Time I acknowlege the many Obligations I am under, & present my best Respects to thyGrandsons, particularly Temple. I am not much in Trade yet have been very attentive to the Goods imported here from France, in examining the spining & weaving & the Quality of the Materials from which they are manufactured, & with Pleasure I can assure thee, that not only in Silks, but Cottons & Linens, say every Kind manufactured in & about Manchester, I think the spinning & weaving rather excel & the Dyes are equal. England to be sure has the Advantage in woollen & worsted as well as Iron & Steel Wares, but the latter we can easily help ourselves in, if Industry & Oeconomy prevails as I wish it. My Partner & self have brought the casting of almost all Kind of Iron ware to acknowledged great Perfection, to the Benefit of ourselves & the public at a large Work we have between this & little Egg-harbour, which could Hands be obtained at reasonable Wages, might be carried to great Extent in other Branches, I think with the Assistance of two Potters and Founders from New England we made last Year & sold near 2000 neat Tea-kettles very pleasing at this Time to the People.\nI trust I need make no Apology to my good Friend for mentioning to him these Matters, believing he continues a Relish for every Exertion of the Sort, in Confidence of which I rest with great Truth & perfect Esteem his very affectionate Friend\n(signed)Abel James\nDr Franklin"

    "content": "CadizFeby. 14. 1809\nSir\nI had the honor to write to you by the Ship \"Bourdeaux\" Richard Law Mr., which left this a short time since for the port of N. York, in my dispatch No. 60 (dated Jany. 28th.) stating the amount of the intelligence then received respecting the last military operations in this country: By subsequent & more particular accounts we are now assured, that in the attack made upon the Duke of Infantado’s advanced guard as mentioned in said dispatch, he lost thewholeof his artillery; & further that the french were not superior in number as was at first supposed; in consequence of these circumstances the government has recalled the Duke from the army, which however on the retirement of the french from the South part of La mancha (a circumstance which confirms the opinion as to their numbers) he had led by forced marches into that province, so as to be at Santa Crux on the 4th. instant: it is now intended that this army shall form the right of General Cuesta’s, & be wholly under his command; General Cuesta himself is actually some leagues advanced beyond the \"Puente d’Almaraz\" with about 25.000.\nIt appears that in the great battle which was fought in the beginning of last month between the french & the combined Spanish & English armies, the french directed their attacks principally against the troops of the allies; that these were completely defeated, & were obliged to embark with the utmost precipitation the Small remains of their force; the Spanish suffered but little; and General Romaña seeing that it had become impossible to defend Gallicia, that Coruña & Ferrol had Surrendered to the french without resistance, has removed with his Army to \"Ciudad Roderigo\", & it is intended that he shall form the left of General Cuesta. General Cuesta will thus have in all nearly 70.000 men, if he shoud be allowed time to effect his junction with these divisions of Infantado & Romana; but it appears that the french who retired from La Mancha, with other divisions are now marching towards him; Even before this they may have given him battle: their numbers are not known, but cannot well be more than 30.000; with these even if they shoud beat Cuesta, it is not probable that they will venture to advance into Andalusia; but if he be allowed Some further time, no apprehension is entertained on that point; & the less, as every day he is receiving reinforcements from this province, where the government has resorted to every means short of a levy \"en masse\" for the purpose of ensuring his success.\nA Part of the french force which attacked the English has moved along by way of Oviedo towards Portugal; that country seems to be abandoned to its fate; its inhabitants talk of defending it with a hundred thousand pikes. Much reliance however cannot be placed in their resistance; moreover their dissatisfaction with the English, which commenced very early, has been lately augmented; & this is of a nature to assist very much the views of the Emperor.\nIn Catalonia the State of Affairs is pretty much the Same as when I wrote last. The french arms do not progress in that quarter; the destruction on both sides is terrible.\nThe attacks on Saragosa have been renewed & carried on with the utmost possible vigor, even desperation on the part of the french: from time⟨t⟩o time it has been apprehended that the place coud not longer hold out, yet to the astonishment of Every⟨o⟩ne, even when the french have gained the greatest advantages, forced themselves into the town, & taken the most advantageous positions, the still greater courage & desperation of the Arragonese has succeeded in repulsing them & always with immense slaughter.\nMarshall Moncey for having failed in that enterprize has been entirely disgraced.\nIn fine the french now possess Navarre, Biscay, Gallicia & the two Castiles, & if they shoud defeat General Cuesta will have also Estremadura & La Mancha; but if they shoud be beaten by him must immediately abandon New Castile.\nThe Emperor returned to France about the end of last Month carrying with him two or three of his best generals, & a considerable body of troops, & leaving his brother at Madrid, whose situation there is far from agreeable; he does not feel quiet in it, & before the late defeat of Infantados advanced guard had made preparations for removing to the northward; even now according to advices which the government at Seville has received from Madrid, he has manifested in Some publick notification an intention of removing his Court to Burgos.\nOn the first instt. arrived here from South Ama. the Spanish ship St. Justo with 9 millions of dollars, her whole cargo estimated at 14 millions.\nOn the 5th. arrived 11 English transports with 2500 soldiers on board. They are not yet landed; it is supposed that they may debark at Puerta Sta. Maria, but certainly not in this city; these troops with 8 hundred which are at Seville where they arrived a short time Since from Portugal, make the whole of the English force now in Spain.\nI have continued to press upon the attention of the supreme Junta my former reclamations upon the Subject of the vessels yet detained at Algesiras; finally a commission of four persons has been appointed to report to it, upon Each respective case; & the repeated assurances which I have received leave me no room to doubt, but that in the course of a very few days, this business will be concluded: I transmit herewith inclosed Copy of the first Secretary of states note to me of the 12th. Inst. on this Subject. With Sentiments of the most perfect respect and consideration Sir Yr. very Ot. St.\nGeorge W. Erving"

Une fois la france eu possession, tous délais ne peuvent être causés que les Etats Unis et leurs commissaires: et Monsieur le Président des Etats-Unis, ne considérant que le Traité, ne croira surement pas devoir s’arrèter à des difficultés qui pourraient être suggèrées par des actes, qui, quant à la France, ne peuvent être que Subordonnés à ce Traité.\nLe Soussigné, en priant Monsieur le secrétaire d’Etat de soumettre le contenu de cet office à Monsieur le Président des Etats Unis, prie Monsieur Madison d’agréer l’assurance de son respect et de sa considération distinguée.\nL.

I expected that Mr. Tracey and Mr. Jackson would not leave Paris till next Monday, but I dined with them this day, and they seem determined upon setting out the day after to morrow: I shall see them to morrow for the Last time, and have therefore only this evening and morning for writing.\nYou can imagine what an addition has been made to my happiness by the arrival of a kind, and tender mother, and of a Sister who fulfills my most sanguine expectations. Yet the desire of returning to America still possesses me. My Country has over me an attractive power which I do not Understand. Indeed I believe that all men have an attachment to their Country, distinct from all other attachments. It is imputed to our fondness for our friends, and relations; yet I am apt to think I should still desire to go home, were all my friends and relations here. I cannot be influenced by my fondness for the Customs and Habits of my Country, for I was so young when I came to Europe, and have been here so long; that I must necessarily have adopted many of their customs.\nBut I have another Reason, for desiring to return to my native Country. I have been such a wandering being these seven years, that I have never performed any regular course of Studies, and am deficient on many Subjects. I wish very much to have a degree at Harvard, and shall probably not be able to obtain it, unless I spend at least one year there. I therefore have serious thoughts of going in the Spring so as to arrive in May or June; stay a twelve-month at Mr. Shaw’s; (who I hope would be as kind to me, as he has been to you and is to my Brothers) and then enter college for the last year, so as to come out with you. I imagine that with steady application I mightin one year, acquire sufficient proficiency, in all the Sciences necessary, for entering the last year. . . however I know not whether I shall do any of these things, for it is still very uncertain whether I shall return next Spring or not.\nI have been this day to see one of the greatest curiosities that P[aris contains]. The abbé L’Epée, Who for many years has made his sole employment, to alleviate, the unhappy fate of that unfortunate class of human beings the Deaf and Dumb. He teaches all, indiscriminately, and whoever desires to be instructed in his method, has only to present himself, and not pretend to offer any recompense because that would give offence. Oh! how consoling it must be to these Europeans, that they are able to say that there still are such Characters who devote all their time, to assist the unfortunate! The name of such a man deserves to be transmitted to Posterity, more than all the Kings in Europe. His success has been astonishing, he teaches the deaf and dumb, not only to converse with each other by signs, but to read and write, and comprehend the most abstracted metaphysical Ideas. He has published a book, which contains his complete System. I would send it you, but it is in French, which you do not understand I suppose sufficiently to read it. When the Emperor was here, he went to see the Abbé, and was so pleased with his School, that when he returned to Vienna, he wrote him a very flattering Letter and sent him a gold box, containing a medal with his Picture.\nYour Mamma in one of her late Letters desired I would get a Violin, for you. Will you accept of that I left at home? My Mamma tells me that Mr. C. Warren had it when she came away; but if he has sailed for Europe, as he intended, he probably left it. I shall never make any use of it, for I have not touched a violin Since I left America: and I fansy I should not be able to get so good a one for you here.\nBelieve me to be, my Dear Cousin, your sincere Friend\nJ.Q.

    "content": "London Broad Street Buildings No. 13Sepr. 9th. 1788\nDear Sir\nThat I am a bad correspondent is so general a complaint against me, that I must expect the same accusation from you—But hear me first.—When there is no matter to write upon a letter is not worth the trouble of receiving and reading, and while any thing, which is to be the subject of a letter, is in suspence, it is difficult to write,and perhaps best to let it alone—“least said is soonest mended,” and nothing said requires no mending.\nThe Model has the good fortune of preserving in England the reputation which it received from the Academy of Sciences. It is a favourite hobby horse with all who have seen it; and every one who have talked with me on the subject advised me to endeavour to obtain a Patent, as it is only by that means that I can secure to myself the direction and management.—For this purpose I went, (in company with Mr. Whiteside) to the office which is an appendage to Lord Sydney’s—told them who I was and made an affidavit that the construction was my own Invention—this was the only step I took in the business. Last Wednesday I received a Patent for England, the next day a Patent for Scotland and I am to have one for Ireland.\nAs I had already the opinion of the Scientific Judges both in France and England on the Model, it was also necessary that I should have that of the practical Iron Men who must finally be the executors of the work.\nThere are several capital Iron works in this Country, the principal of which are those in Shropshire, Yorkshire and Scotland.—It was my intention to have communicated with Mr. Wilkinson who is one of the proprietors of the Shropshire Iron Works and concerned in those in France, but his departure for Sweden before I had possession of the patents prevented me.\nThe Iron Works in Yorkshire belonging to the Walkers near to Sheffield are the most eminent in England in point of establishment and property. The proprietors are reputed to be worth two hundred thousand pounds and consequently capable of giving energy to any great undertaken. A friend of theirs who had seen the Model wrote to them on the Subject, and two of them came to London last Fryday to see it and talk with me on the business.\nTheir opinion is very decided that it can be executed either in Wrought or Cast Iron and I am to go down to their Works next week to erect an experiment Arch. This is the point I am now got to; and until now I had nothing to inform you of.—If I succeed in creating the Arch all reasoning and opinion will be at an end, and as this will soon be known, I shall not return to France till that time, and until then I wish every thing to remain, respecting any Bridge over the Seine, in the State I left matters in when I came from France. With respect to the Patents in England it is my intention to dispose of them as soon as I have established the certainty of the construction.\nBesides the ill success of Black friars Bridge, two Bridges built successively on the same spot, the last by Mr. Smeaton, at Hexham over the Tyne in Northumberland have fallen down occasioned by quicksands under the bed of the river.—If therefore Arches can be extended in the proportion the Model promises, the construction in certain situations, without regard to cheapness or dearness will be valuable in all Countries.\nI enclose you a Philadelphia Paper 10 of July having the account of theProcession of the 4thof that month. An Arrival from Philadelphia which left it the 26th. July brings nothing new.—The Convention of New York was still sitting; but we have accounts, tho’ I know not how they came, that the Convention of N. York acceeded on the 29th of July. I since hear that this account is brought by the Columbine in 29 days from N. York, arrived at Falmouth, with wheat to Lisbon.\nAs to English News or Politics, here is little more than what the public Papers contain.—The assembling the States General and the reappointment of Mr. Neckar make considerable impression here. They overawe a great deal of the English habitual rashness and checks that triumph of presumption which they indulge themselves in with respect to what they called the deranged and almost ruinous condition of the finances of France. They acknowlege unreservedly that the natural resources of france are greater than those of England but they plume themselves on the superiority of the Means necessary to bring national resources forth. But the two circumstances, above mentioned, serve very much to lower this exultation.\nSome time ago I spent aWeek at Mr. Burkesand the Duke of Portland’s in Buckenhamshire. You will recollect that the duke was the Minister during the time of the Coalition. He is now in the opposition, and I find the opposition as much warped in some respects as to Continental Politics as the Ministry.\nWhat the extent of the Treaty with Prussia is, Mr. B——says that he and all the opposition are totally unacquainted with, and they speak of it not as a very wise measure, but rather tending to involve England in unnecessary continental disputes. The preference of the opposition is to a connection with Russia if it could have been obtained.\nSir George Staunton tells me that the interference with respect to Holland last year met with considerable opposition from part of the Cabinet. Mr. Pitt was against it at first, but it was a favourite measure with the King, and that the opposition at that Crisis contrivedto have it known to him that they were disposed to support his measures. This, together with the notification of the 16th. of Sepr. gave Mr. Pitt cause and pretence for changing his ground.\nThe Marquis of Landsdown is unconnected either with the Ministry or the opposition. His politics is distinct from both. This plan is a sort of Armed Neutrality which has many Advocates. In Conversation with me he reprobated the Conduct of the Ministry towards France last year as operating to “cut the throat of Confidence” (this was his expression) between France and England at a time when there was a fair opportunity of improving it.\nThe Enmity of this Country against Russia is as bitter as it ever was against America, and is carried to every Pitch of abuse and vulgarity. What I hear in Conversations exceed what may be seen in the News papers. They are sour and mortified at every success she acquires and voraciously believe and rejoice in the most improbable accounts and rumours to the contrary. You may mention this to Mr. Simolin in any terms you please for you cannot exceed the fact.\nThere are those who amuse themselves here in the hopes of managing Spain. The Notification which the Marquis del Campo made last year to the British Cabinet is, perhaps, the only secret that is kept in this Country. Mr. B——tells me that the opposition knows nothing of it.\nThey all very freely admit that if the Combined fleets had had thirty or forty thousand land forces when they came up the Channel last War, there was nothing in England to oppose their landing, and that such a measure would have been fatal to their resources, by, at least, a temporary destruction of national Credit. This is the point in which this Country is most impressible. Wars, carried on at a distance, they care but little about, and seem always disposed to enter into them. It is bringing the matter home to them that makes them fear and feel, for their weakest part is at home. This I take to be the reason of the attention they are paying to Spain, for while France and Spain make a Common Cause, andStarttogether, they may easily overawe this Country.\nI intended sending this letter by Mr. Parker but he goes by the way of Holland and as I do not chuse to send it by the English Post, I shall desire Mr. Bartholemy to forward it to you.\nRemember me with much Affection to the Marquis de la Fayette. This letter will serve for two letters. Whether I am in London or the Country any letter to me at Mr. Whiteside Merchant No. 13 Broad Street Buildings will come safe. My Compliments toMr. Short. I am Dear Sir with great Esteem your Obliged Friend & Ob. Hble Servant,\nThomas Paine\nSepr. 15th.\nThis letter was intended to go by the last dispatches of Mr. Bartholemey but was too late. I have since seen a New-york paper of the 8th. of August, in which there is a circular letter from the Convention of New-york signed by the President (Governor Clinton) to the several Legislatures which states, that altho’ they had acceeded to the foedral Constitution, from principles of regard to the Union, it was, in the opinion of a Majority of them, exceptionable in many points; and recommending that another Convention be hereafter assembled, agreeable to the provision made in the Constitution, for the purpose of reforming altering &c. Nothing particular, as to defect, is pointed at in the Circular letter, the expressions are general, and they disclaim all local Ideas.\nA Motion was made in Congress that the New Congress meet at Baltimore which was carried 7 States to 6. The question was reconsidered the next day, and carried 7 to 6 for New York, in this state it stood when the Vessel sailed.\nIt was said some time ago in the English Newspapers, that five officers of the Sweedish Army had withdrawn and refused to serve, because the King had undertaken anOffensiveWar, without consulting and having the concurrence of the Senate, agreeable to an Article in their form of government; but a Gentleman who is intimate at Baron Nolkins the Sweedish Minister’s tells me that athirdof the officers have made that objection, which has disabled the progress of the Sweedish Army in Finland.\nWhether I shall set off a catenarian Arch or an Arch of a Circle I have not yet determined, but I mean to set off both and take my choice. There is one objection against a Catenarian Arch, which is, that the Iron tubes being all cast in one form will not exactly fit every part of it.\nAn Arch of a Circle may be sett off to any extent by calculating the Ordinates, at equal distances on the diameter. In this case, the Radius will always be the Hypothenuse, the portion of the diameter be the Base, and the Ordinate the perpendicular or the Ordinate may be found by Trigonometry in which the Base, Hypothenuse and right angle will be always given.\nI think the Arch will appear rather handsomer if the direction of the Blocks and Bolts, were always in the direction of the Radius as I first proposed but which I changed in the drawing and placedas perpendiculars to the Cord instead of the Curve to remedy the inconvenience of the deverging of the Bolts as you mentioned.\nIn a very large Arch of 4 or 600 feet Cord, this deverging will be considerable, about 3 or 4 tenths of an Inch on every two feet—but this difficulty may be effectually remedied, and the direction of the radius preserved by making the Bar in two halves, with half a hole in each; they will then be put on sideways and may be united by clamps. This method will exceedingly facilitate the raising or putting the Arch together, and shorten the time of the Work on the River very considerably. I am not fond of hazarding opinions, neither is it proper or prudent to do it, but I think that after every thing is prepared, a Bridge over such a River as the Seine, might be put up in three months time—or less, as all the Arches would be began on at once, and the work would admit of as many hands being employed at the same time as you please.\nI have not heard anything of Mr: Littlepage since I left Paris. If you have I shall be glad to know it. As he dined sometimes at Mr. Neckar’s he undertook to describe the Bridge to him. Mr. Neckar very readily conceived it. If you have an opportunity of seeing Mr. Neckar, and see it convenient to renew the subject, you mention that I am going forward with an Experiment Arch.\nMr. Le Couteulx desired me to examine the construction of the Albion or Steem Mills erected by Bolton and Watts. I have not yet written to him because I had nothing certain to write about. I have talked with Mr. Rumsey who is here, upon this matter, and who appears to me to be master of that subject and who has procured aModel of the Millwhich is worked originally from the Steem, but it will be necessary to know what proposals Mr. Le Couteulx will make to any person who will undertake to construct his spare Steem Engines, of which he has one always in each Building, into a Mill, and conduct the operation. In this case Mr. Rumsey appears to me the very person Mr. Le Couteulx wants. The enclosed letter to Mr. Le Couteulx is on this subject.\nThere has been some proposals passed on each side between Bolton and Rumsey in which I think the former has taken advantage of the unsuspicious openess of the latter.\nI have again enquired aboutthe map, and find it is engraving at the place you mentioned. It will be 8 feet by 6 and the price about 2 Guineas but they cannot tell me the time it will be finished. I informed you of the Air pump in my letter to you by Mr. Quesney. When you see Mr. Le Roy please to present my Compliments. I hope I shall now reallize the opinion of the Academy onthe Model, in which case I shall give the Academy the proper information.\nWe have no certain accounts here of the arrangement of the new Ministry. The papers mention Count St. Priest for foreign Affairs. When you see him please to present my Compliments.\nThe New York Packet is arrived this Morning. She sailed the eighth of Augs. and brings nothing new. The Majority in the Convention of N. York was but three.\nThe question for the meeting of Congress at Philadelphia was put and lost. Please to present my Compliment to M. & Madame de Corney."

    "content": "Quincy, May 2, 1809.\nSirs,\nTHE message mentioned in my last letter, was in these words:\nGentlemen of the Senate,\nThe proposition of a fresh negociation with France, in consequence of advances made by the French government, has excited so general an attention and so much conversation, as to have given occasion to many manifestations of the public opinion, from which it appears to me, that a new modification of the embassy will give more general satisfaction to the legislature and to the nation, and perhaps better answer the purposes we have in view. It is on this supposition, and with this expectation, that I now nominate Oliver Ellsworth, Esq. Chief Justice of the United States, Patrick Henry, Esq. late Governor of Virginia, and William Vans Murray, Esq. our Minister Resident at the Hague, to be Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary to the French Republic, with full powers to discuss and settle by a treaty all controversies between the United States and France. It is not intended that the two former of these gentlemen shall embark for Europe, until they shall have received from the Executive Directory assurances signified by their Secretary of foreign relations, that they shall be received in character, that they shall enjoy all the prerogatives attached to that character by the law of nations, and that a minister or ministers of equal powers shall be appointed and commissioned to treat with them.\nJohn Adams.\nFeb. 25, 1799.\nTo these nominations the Senate advised and consented, and commissions were prepared. My friend, Mr. Henry declined, on account of his age, and Governor Davie, of North-Carolina, was appointed in his place. During all this transaction, no motion was made in Senate, to pass a resolution that a mission to France was inexpedient. With the despatches from Talleyrand before his eyes, I believe no member of the Senate would have been willing to record his name in favor of such a resolution, among the yeas and nays. The deputation of Senators made no remonstrances to me against the mission, or the diplomatic communications on which it was founded, but only against the missionary, Mr. Murray.\nI sent an invitation to the heads of departments to assemble in my chamber, to consult upon the instructions to be given to our envoys. They all met me accordingly, and in several long evenings entered into a very serious and deliberate discussion of every article that was to be demanded and insisted on in the proposed treaty. They were all unanimously agreed upon to my entire satisfaction, and reduced to writing. I committed them to the secretary of state, to be reduced into proper form, to have a fair copy made and transmitted to me, for revision, correction or signature, as there might be occasion.\nThe yellow fever was expected, and we wert all obliged to fly for our lives: myself and all my family to Quincy, and the heads of departments, with the public offices, to Trenton.\nI had repeatedly endeavored to impress upon the mind of the secretary of state, the necessity of transmitting to me as soon as possible, his draught of the instructions, that they might be finished and signed, and every thing prepared for the departure of the envoys. I waited with much concern, expecting from day to day to receive the instructions; but no instructions appeared. At length, instead of them, I received a letter signed by all five of the heads of departments, earnestly entreating me tosuspend the mission!\nI was astonished at this unexpected, this obstinate and persevering opposition to a measure, that appeared so clearly to me to be so essential to the peace and prosperity of the nation, and the honor of the government, at home and abroad. I was not a little surprised at the unanimity of the heads of departments, for two of them had always appeared moderate and candid in relation to this mission. My instantaneous determination was to go to Trenton, meet the gentlemen face to face, to confer with them coolly on the subject, and convince them, or be convinced by them, if I could. On my way, I called upon Chief Justice Ellsworth, at his seat in Windsor, and had a conversation of perhaps two hours with him. He was perfectly candid. Whatever should be the determination, he was ready at an hour’s warning to comply. If it was thought best to embark immediately, he was ready. If it was judged more expedient to postpone it for a little time, though that might subject him to a winter voyage, that danger had no weight with him. If it was concluded to defer it till the spring, he was willing to wait. In this disposition I took leave of him. He gave me no intimation that he had any thought of a journey to Trenton. I lodged at Hartford, not yet purified of the yellow fever, and there I caught something very like it, or at least almost as bad, a most violent cold, attended with a constant fever, which rendered me for six weeks more fit for a chamber and bed of sickness, than for uncomfortable journeys, or much labor of the head or hands. However, I would not consent to be retarded on my journey, and reached Trenton, where Mr. Hamilton had arrived a few hours before me. Governor Davie had been there some time. Ill as I was, I sent for the heads of departments. Four of them were there. The attorney general was gone to Virginia. Many days were employed in conferences with them, sometimes at my own apartments, and sometimes at their offices.\nThe inhabitants of Trenton had been wrought up to a pitch of political enthusiasm that surprised me. The universal opinion appeared to be, that the first arrivals from Europe would bring the glorious news, that Louis the Eighteenth was restored to the throne of France, and reigning triumphantly at Versailles. Suwarrow, at the head of his victorious Russian army, was to have marched from Italy to Paris, on one side, and Prince Charles, at the head of an Austrian army, was to have marched from Germany to Paris on the other, and detachments from both armies were to march down to Havre, to receive the king, who was to be brought over by a British fleet and escorted with flying colours to Versailles. I could scarcely believe my own senses when I heard such reveries.—Yet the heads of departments appeared to believe them, and urge them as decisive arguments for suspending the embarkation of our envoys till the spring. In vain did I urge the immense distances the two imperial armies had to march, the great number of towns and cities in the route of both, in positions chosen with great skill, fortified with exquisite art, defended by vast trains of heavy ordnance, garrisoned by numerous troops of soldiers perfectly disciplined, and animated with all the obstinacy and ardor of the revolutionary spirit. In vain did I alledge the military maxim, which would certainly govern both Prince Charles and Suwarrow, that is,never to leave a fortified city in the rear of your army, in possession of your enemy. That the siege of one town would consume the whole season.—That neither the Russians nor Austrians were probably provided with the mortars and heavy cannon necessary for sieges.—Nothing would do—Louis XVIII. must be upon the throne of France.—Well, suppose he is, what harm will there be in embarking our envoys? They will congratulate his Majesty, and if his Majesty cannot receive them under their credentials to the French Republic, he will be glad to see them in his kingdom, and assure them of his royal protection till they can write home for fresh commissions, and such shall be ready for them at a minute’s warning. In vain did I urge the entire change of property in France, and the necessity the present possessors were under to defend themselves at every sacrifice and every risque. Mr. Ellsworth had arrived in two or three days after me. I invited him and Governor Davie to dine with me alone, that we might converse with entire freedom. At table, Mr. Ellsworth expressed an opinion somewhat similar to that of the heads of departments and the public opinion of Trenton. Is it possible, Chief Justice, said I, that you can seriously believe that the Bourbons are or will be soon restored to the throne of France? Why, said Mr. Ellsworth, smiling,it looks a good deal so. I should not be afraid to stake my life upon it, that they will not be restored in seven years, if they ever are, was my reply. And then I entered into a long detail of my reasons for this opinion. They would be too tedious to enumerate here, and time has superceded the necessity of them.\nThe result of the conversation was, that Mr. Davie was decidedly for embarking immediately, as he always had been from his first arrival, and Mr. Ellsworth declared himself satisfied and willing to embark as soon as I pleased.\nMr. Hamilton, who had been some time in town and had visited me several times, came at last to remonstrate against the mission to France. I received him with great civility, as I always had done from my first knowledge of him. I was fortunately in a very happy temper and very good humor. He went over the whole ground of the victories of Suwarrow and Prince Charles, and the inflexible determination of the two imperial courts, in concert with G. Britain, to restore the house of Bourbon to their kingdom. That there was no doubt the enterprise was already accomplished, or at least it would be, before the end of the campaign. That Mr. Pitt was determined to restore the Bourbons. That the confidence of the nation in Mr. Pitt was unbounded. That the nation was never so united, and determined to support Mr. Pitt and his resolution to restore the monarchy of France.—His eloquence and vehemence wrought the little man up to a degree of heat and effervescence like that which Gen. Knox used to describe of his conduct in the battle of Monmouth, and which General Lee used to call hisparoxysmsof bravery, but which he said would never be of any service to his country. I answered him in general, as I had answered the heads of departments and Judge Ellsworth—but to no purpose. He repeated over and over again the unalterable resolution of Mr. Pitt and the two imperial courts, the invincible heroism os Suwarrow and Prince Charles, and the unbounded confidence of the British empire in Mr. Pitt, with such agitation and violent action, that I really pitied him, instead of being displeased. I only added, that I differed with him in opinion on every point, and that instead of restoring the Bourbons, it would not be long before England would make peace. I treated him throughout with great mildness and civility; but after he took leave, I could not help reflecting in my own mind on the total ignorance he had betrayed of every thing in Europe, in France, England, and elsewhere. Instead of that unbounded confidence in Mr. Pitt, I knew that the nation had been long working up almost to a ripeness for rebellion against Mr. Pitt, for continuing the war. Accordingly it was not long before Mr. Pitt was obliged to resign, peace at Amiens was made, and Napoleon acknowledged. Mr. Hamilton in his most famous pamphlet, has hinted at this conversation, and squinted at my simplicity for expecting peace.\nUpon the whole, I directed the instructions to be prepared, the heads of departments were assembled, and the instructions deliberately considered, paragraph by paragraph, and unanimously approved by me and by them. Indeed there had never been any difference of opinion among us on any article of the instructions.\nThe instructions were presented to the envoys, and they requested to embark in the United States frigate as soon as possible.—For some cause or other in the state of the ship, they landed in Spain, and went by land from Corunna to Paris on the same route which Mr. Dana and I had travelled twenty years before, that is, in 1780. Before their arrival, a revolution had occurred, and the Consular government succeeded the Directory.\nHad Mr. Murray’s nomination been approved, he would probably have finished the business long before, and obtained compensation for all spoliations.\nJohn Adams."

There will be so much Uneasiness among them, if that Authority is not exerted, that there will probably be no Congress formed before Christmas, and a few who will venture into the City will be there in Idleness and out of their Element.\nI thank you for the Sentiments you have expressed relative to the System to be pursued. Can you send me a Copy of the Speech, at the Commencement of last session? I have no Copy of it here, and perhaps shall find it difficult to procure one.\nI should be glad however to know your Opinion whether our Envoys will be recd or not? whether they will Succeed or not? with hints at Your reasons: if any Intelligence has furnished any.\nThe organization of the Stamp Tax Suggests a Vexation to me. The Bill was worth Money and Money was so much wanted for the public Service, that I would not put it at risque. Otherwise I would have negatived that Bill. Not from Personal feelings for I care not a farthing for all the personal Power in the World. But The Office of the Secretary of the Treasury is in that Bill, premeditatedly sett up as a rival to that of the President: and that Policy will be pursued if We are not on our guard till We have a quintuple or a Centuple Executive Directory, with all the babylonish dialect which modern Pedants much affect.\nI pray you to continue to write me as often as possible\nWith high Esteem, I am, Dear sir, your / very humble servant\nJohn Adams"

    "content": "Quincy March 13th 1809\nGentlemen\nI have received your very civil Letter of the third of this Month with Emotions very similar to those which I felt, many years ago upon the following Occasion.—\nReturning from Holland to Paris in 177[8]4 I was invited to dine with my Wife and Daughter by the Baron De Stael, Ambassador from Sweeden, As I was the first of the Corps Diplomatic who arrived, the Ambassador was shewing me a fine Portrait of the King of Sweeden his Master, when the Count Deodati Ambassador from the Elector of Saxony came in. After Compliments to De Stael Deodati turned to me whom he had known Several years before and the following Dialogue ensued,—\nDeodati. Very well! Mr. Adams! You are a Republican I suppose.\nAdams, You are in the right, Mr. Ambassador, I have the honor to be a Republican.—\nDeodati. And your Countrymen are Republicans, and your Government is Republican.\nAdams. Certainly. My Countrymen are Republicans and our Government is Republican.\nDeodati. And you have made your Countrymen and your Government Republican.\nAdams. Not at all, Sir my Country and its Government have been Republican from their origion, and long before I was born.\nDeodati. Very well! you at least have made your Country very Celebrated you have made it, independent.—You have made an astonishing Treaty with Holland.—you have made a Marvelous Peace with England. you have made her Acknowledge your Independence\nAdams I beg your pardon Sir, you are too polite; you do me too much honor, I have no pretensions to have performed all those great Acts however I have acted a part in Some of those affairs,\nDeodati But! very well!—I will now tell the Recompence you will receive, for all that you have done.—\nAdams I shall be very glad to hear your Prognostications concerning my Destiny.\nDeodati. Your Fortune will be that of all the <Injustice, of the A> Republicans, of Aristides of Phocion: of Miltiades: of Scipio & &\nAdams, I believe it.\nDeodati You believe it?\nAdams Yes\nDeodati you will experience all the Ingratitude all the Injustice of the ancient Republicans.\nAdams. I expect it: and always have expected it.—\nDeodati. you will be ill treated, hated, despised and persecuted.\nAdams. I have no doubt of all that, It is in the ordinary nature and Course of Things.\nDeodati. Your Virtue must be very heroical, or your Philosophy very Stoical to undertake all those Adventures, with your Eyes open, for such a Reward.—\nSo much for Deodati and his warning Voice! and so much for my well grounded Anticipations.—\nThis is no fabulous Dialogue of the Dead: but strict historical Truth.\nA curious coalition of French and English Emissaries with Federal and Republican Libellers have so compleatly fulfilled the Prophecy of Deodati and my own—Forebodings, so totally destroyed my Reputation by their Calumnies, that I have neither Power nor Influence to do any Thing for my Country to assist her in her present distresses or guard her against future Calamities. Nothing remains to me but the Right of private Judgment, and that I exercise freely, and communicate my sentiments as freely to those who wish to know them.—\nI am totis Viribus against any division of the Union by the North River or by Delaware River, or by the Potomack or any other River or by any Chain of Mountains, I am for maintaing the Independence of the Nation at all Events—\nI am no Advocate for Mr Gores Declaration of War against France knowing as I do from personal Experience the mutually friendly dispositions between the People of France and the People of America, Bonaparte out of the Question, I shall be very Sorry to see them converted into ill will and old English Prejudice revived, Lasting Injuries and Misfortunes would arise to this country from such a Change.—I am averse also to a War with England, and wish to maintain our Neutrality as long as possible without conceeding important Principles. If either of the belligerent Powers force us all into a War, I am for fighting that Power whichever it may be.—\nI always consider the whole Nation as my Children: but they have almost all been undutiful to me, you two Gentlemen are almost the only ones out of my own house, who have for a long time and I thank you for it expressed a fillial affection for,\nJohn Adams"

    "content": "Morris Town April 10th 1777\nDear Sir\nI have, within these few days, received an application from the honorable Messrs Sever and Cushing, for arms and blankets, for the use of the Massachusetts regiments, destined for Ticonderoga. Surely those troops are not, at this day, to begin their march, for that post! And sorry I am to observe, that nothing now will content that government, but the new arms lately arrived there, which will be greatly wanted for troops, that cannot otherwise be provided, when I have abundant reason to believe, that no State upon the Continent has it so much in her power to furnish these articles, as that of Massachusetts-Bay. Indeed, I am informed, that arms and other military stores are hoarding up, in that government, which makes everything of the kind exceedingly difficult to be had for Continental use, and has the appearance of a separate provision.\nThat no delay however may happen, I have informed those Gentlemen, that you would be instructed to issue orders, for such a number of arms, as shall appear to you absolutely necessary; and this power I now give you, requesting at the same time, that it may be used with a regard to the general good. The means of procuring them, through other channels, should still be persued.\nWith respect to the blankets, The Clothier General, to whom I have written, must direct, as I do not care to interfere in his department.\nThese Gentlemen have also written to me concerning some powder, due from the Continent to the State of Massachusetts, about fifteen tons, they say. I really thought, this demand had been satisfied long ago, out of the 75 tons taken nearly at this time last year. If it has not, I have no objection to returning what has been had for the use of the army, but with respect to that lent to the armed vessels, if it happened since my departure from Boston, I can give no order, as it is not within my department, but comes properly before that of the marine. You must therefore discriminate; and as I think General Ward was instructed to repay the powder, borrowed from the Massachusetts-Bay, I wish you to inquire of him and the Commissary of Stores, by what means it was neglected.\nLet me have the names of the several Colonels commanding the 15 regiments, from the state of Massachusetts. Mention them in their order of seniority, and whether the regiments are numbered from therank of the officers commanding them, or not: Also inform me, which regiments come this way and which go to Ticonderoga. If it does not break in upon any disposition already made, I would have Glover and Patterson come forward with the eight regiments to Peeks-Kill.\nThe Brigade Majors, for these new corps, are not to be appointed ’till there is duty for them to perform: Then, if the Brigadiers will make choice of officers properly qualified, I will confirm them in office; if they do not, I shall exert the powers given me by Congress, “to appoint all officers, under the rank of Brigadier,” to put in such as are; as I will not have any Gentleman introduced from Family-connexions or local attachments, to the prejudice of the service. Of this you will please, without loss of time, to give each Brigadier of your state, notice. They will excuse me for this intimation, which may imply a reflection, when I add, that some very improper choices were made last year, and when it is evident to every Gentleman in the smallest degree acquainted with service, that nothing can contribute more to order and regularity, in an army, than having Brigade-Majors of knowledge, activity and diligence.\nI cannot conclude, without again urging you, in explicit and positive terms, to hasten the troops to the several posts assigned them. The delay in marching may prove as fatal as not inlisting the men. We have every reason from information and observation, to believe that General Howe is upon the point of taking the field; and the troops, with which he is to be opposed, are yet in their respective States. I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant,\nGo: Washington"

    "content": "London 17 March 1792\nDear Sir,\nI had the Honor to write to you on the fourth of last Month. Two Days after, I was informed that you had nominated me as Minister to the Court of France, but the latest Advices from America, which come down to the tenth of January, shew that the Senate had not then made their Decision. Be that Decision what it may, I shall ever gratefully esteem and acknowlege this Mark of Confidence from the Person in the World whose good opinion I consider as most estimable.\nIn my Letter of the fourth, I gave you a Picture of the french Ministry, and a View of the Measures pursued by different Parties, including the Mission of the bishop d’autun. Ashehas now got back to Paris it may be well to communicate the Results. His Reception was bad for three Reasons. First that the Court looks with Horror and Apprehension at the Scenes acting in France, of which they consider him as a prime Mover. Secondly, that his Reputation is offensive to Persons who pique themselves on Decency of Manners & Deportment. And lastly because he was so imprudent, when he first arrived, as to propogate the Idea that he should corrupt the Members of Administration; and afterwards by keeping Company with leading Characters among the Dissenters and other similar Circumstances he renewed the Impression made before his Departure from Paris that he meant to intrigue with the discontented. His public Reception howeverfurnishes no Clue to decide on the Success of his Mission; because the former might have been very bad and the latter very good. The Fact however is that he could offer Nothing worthy of their Acceptance, and that what he asked was of a Nature not to be granted. This Offer was confined to a Cession of Tobago, a Demolition of the Portes of Cherburgh, & an Extension of the commercial Treaty. He asked a strict Neutrality in Case of War with the Emperor. Now you will observe that no Court would prudently treat with France in her present Situation, seeing that no body can promise in her Name otherwise than as Godfathers and Godmothers do at a Christening, and how such Promises are kept every Body knows. Convinced of this, the Bishop never told his Errand to Lord Gower, the British Embassador at Paris, who mentioned that Circumstance to me as extraordinary, but yet as so far agreable in that he was glad not to have been called on for Letters of Introduction.\nRespecting Tobago, I must make a Digression. It is now a long Time since it was mentioned to me, in Paris, that some of the Colonists of St Domingo had come hither to make overtures to Mr Pitt. Since that Period I learnt that the french Ministry were in Possession of Documents to prove, not only that he fomented the Disturbances in France, but that he was in deep Intrigues with Regard to that Colony. The particular Proofs were not shewn to me; so that I cannot speak positively. Neither can I vouch for what I have learnt further on that Subject within this Month, but I am assured that it is Mr Pitts Intention to bring about if he can the Independence of St Domingo. Mr Clarkson, the great Negro Advocate, is mentioned to me as his agent for their Business at Paris; and the Conduct of a Part of the Assembly in opposing Succor to that Island seems corroborative of such Idea. This then being the Case, or supposing it to be so, the Offer of Tobago was too trifling to attract Mr Pitts notice, even if unconnected with other Circumstances. By the bye my Informant tells me also that Mr Pitt means to coax us into the Adoption of his Plan respecting St Domingo. And I learn from another Quarter that he means to offer us his Mediation for a Peace with the Indians. If all this be true, his Game is evident. The Mediation is to be with us a Price for adopting his Plans, and with the Indian Tribes a Means of constituting himself their Patron and Protector. It may be proper to combine all this with the late Division ofCanada, and the present Measures for military Colonization of the upper Country, and above all with what may come from Mr Hammond. I return to St Domingo. If such be Mr Pitt’s Scheme, altho we shall not I presume engage in or countenance it, yet the Success will beentirelyfor our Advantage, and a meer preliminary to Something of the same Sort which must happen to Jamaica at the first Change of wind in the political world. The Destruction of the Port of Cherbourg is no present Object with the british Ministry, because they suppose it will be ruined by the Elements before it can be compleated, and because the french Marine is (from the want of Discipline) an Object more of Contempt than apprehension. The profferd Extension of the Commercial Treaty amounts to Nothing, because at present every Part of France is open to contraband Commerce, and because there is little Reason to beleive that the Stipulations in a Treaty now made would be of any long Duration. Thus it happens that neither of the Objects offered were worthy of Notice. But the Neutrality required was of a most important Nature. By leaving the Austrian low Countries exposed to french Invasion, it would have been a Violation both of antient and of recent Treaties. Nor is this all, for (as I have already had occasion to remark) the Annexation of those Provinces to the french Monarchy would prove almost, if not altogether, fatal to Great Britain. And when we consider that they are almost in Revolt already, and that it is in fact their Interest to become one with France, there is some Reason to suppose that an Union might have been effected in Case of a War with the Emperor. So much then on the Ground of Good Faith and good Policy, but there is still a further Cause which as the World goes may be equal in its Operation to all others. It seems to be a moot Point whether it is the british or the prussian Cabinet which directs the other. Perhaps there may be a little of both, but be all that as it may, this much is certain that neither feels disposed to counteract the Views of its Ally in any open manner. Now putting aside the personal Feelings which naturally agitate the Sovereign of this as well as of Other Kingdoms in Regard to the french Revolution, it is notorious that, from the very Dawn of it, Agents were employed to foment a Spirit of Revolt in other States; particularly in Prussia. The King of Prussia therefore feels for the french Revolutionists all the Enmity of a proud passionate and offended germanPrince. Add to this that the Elector of Hanover, as such, cannot wish for a Change in the Government of Germany. If therefore it had been the Interest of Great Britain to establish a free Constitution in France (which it certainly is not) I am perfectly convinced that this Court would never have made a single Effort for the Purpose.\nI stated to you in my last the french Ministry as being extremely disjointed. It was too much so for any durable Existence, besides which the Members took effectual Means to precipitate each others Ruin. Mr de Narbonne wished to get into the Office of foreign Affairs. This was desirable to him (it is said) on many accounts but particularly so because it gives the Command of large Sums without Account. Whatever may have been his Motives, the following seems to have been his Conduct. He stood forth the Advocate of all violent Measures. This would naturally have excited Suspicions with thinking Men, but not so with the Assembly. He associated himself to the Partizans of Democracy, and while by this Means he secured himself against their Clamors, he took great Care of his pecuniary Affairs. This at least is affirmed to me, and with the addition that he had the Imprudence to pay off his Debts altho it is notorious that his Estate, which is in St Domingo, is among those which are laid Waste. It is further asserted, that in order to quiet the Clamors of Contractors who had given him money and found themselves in the Road to Ruin he agreed to compensate the Depreciation of the Assignats. In order to remove a great Obstacle to his Proceedings he joined in the Intrigues against Mr Bertrand, and at the same Time fostered other Intrigues against Mr Delessart with a View of getting his Place. The Proofs of all these things are said to be in the King’s Hands. Mr Delessart’s Conduct I have already in Part communicated. I must add that, afterwards, imagining that Brissot de Warville and Condorcet were omnipotent in the Assembly he violated his Engagements made with the Triumvirate, and wrote some Dispatches conformably to the Views of those two Gentlemen. In Consequence of this it was resolved to displace him, and they were looking out for a Successor. The person applied to was actually deliberating whether he should or should not accept, at the Moment when Brissot brought about his Impeachment and Arrest. In this same Moment Mr de Narbonne was dismissed, and with him was to go Monsieur de Gerville.The Chevalier de Grave succeeds Mr de Narbonne. When I left Paris he was attached to the Triumvirate. He does not want for Understanding, but I think it almost impossible that he should succeed. Monsr Bertrand against whom an Address from the Assembly was at length carried, has I find resigned. There is Something at the Bottom which I cannot discover, without being on the Spot, but you may rely on it he goes out with the full Confidence of the King and Queen.\nMy Informations from Paris were previous to the News of the Emperor’s Death, which has probably occasioned the violent Proceedings against poor de lessart, by removing the Fears of those who (in the Midst of all their big Words) were confoundedly frightened. What may be the Consequences of this Event it is impossible to determine, or even to conjecture. Much, very much, depends on the personal Character of his Successor which I am not yet acquainted with.\nIt is supposed, by some here, that Mr Pitt is not strong in the Cabinet at present, altho the Majority in Parliament was never more decisive, and this is said to arise from his refusing to ask Money for Payment of the Prince of Wales’s Debts which the King it is said was desirous of, and which his Minister declinedwith some offensive Expressions.Mr Pitt’s Friends insist on the other Hand that the whole Story is false from Begining to End. For my own Part, I do not think he will be turned out, because I beleive him to be a very cunning Fellow; and altho he has conducted foreign Affairs but poorly, he manages all the little Court and parliamentary Intrigues with consummate Address. Farewell my dear Sir, I am ever truly yours\nGouvr Morris"

    "content": "Richmond Hill July 18. 1789\nDear sir\nIn my Letter of Yesterday, I think it was demonstrated that the English Constitution is a Republic, and that the Regal Negative upon the Laws, is essential to that Republic: because that without it, that Government would not be what it is a monarchical Republic, and consequently could not preserve the Ballance of Power between, the Executive and Legislative Powers, nor that other Ballance, which is in the Legislative between the one, the few and the many, in which two Ballances the Excellence of that form of Government, consists.\nLet Us now enquire, whether the new Constitution of the United States is, or is not a monarchical Republic, like that of G. Britain.— The Monarchical, and the Aristocratical Power, in our Constitution, it is true are not hereditary: but this makes no difference in the nature of the Power, in the nature of the Ballance, or in the name of the Species of Government.— it would make no difference in the Power of a Judge, or Justice, or General, or Admiral, whether his Commission were for Life or Years. his authority, during the time it lasted would be the Same, whether it were for one Year or twenty, or for Life, or descendible to his eldest son.— The People The Nation, in whom all Power resides originally, may delegate their Power, for one Year, or for ten Years, for Years or for Life, or may delegate it in fee simple, or fee Tail, if I may so express my self or during good behaviour, or at Will, or till further orders. A nation might unanimously create a Dictator or Despot, for one Year, or more, or for Life, or for Perpetuity with hereditary descent. in Such a Case, the Dictator for one Year, would as really be a Dictator during the Time, his Power lasted, as the other would be whose Power was perpetual and descendible.— a Nation in the Same manner might create a Simple Monarch, for Years, Life or Perpetuity, and in either Case the Creature would be equally a Simple Monarch during the Continuance of his Power. so the People of England might create King, Lords and commons, for a Year, or for several Years, or for Life—and in any of these Cases, their Government would be a monarchical Republic, or if you will a limited Monarchy, during its continuance, as much as it is now, when the King and Nobles are hereditary. They might make their house of commons hereditary too. what the Consequence of this would be it is easy to foresee: but it would notin the first moment make any change in the legal Power, nor in the name of the Government.\nLet Us now consider what our Constitution is: and see whether any other name can with propriety be given it: than that of a monarchical Republic, or if you will a limited Monarchy.— The Duration of our President is neither perpetual nor for Life, it is only for four Years: but his Power, during those four Years, is much greater than that of an Avoyer, a Consul a Podesta, a Doge, a Statholder, nay than a King of Poland.— nay than a King of Sparta.— I know of no first Magistrate, in any Republican Government, excepting England and Neuchattel, who possesses a constitutional Dignity, Authority and Power comparable to his.— The Power of Sending and receiving Ambassadors of raising and commanding Armies and Navies, of nominating appointing and commissioning all Offices—of managing the Treasures, the internal and external affairs of the nation—nay the whole Executive Power, co extensive with the Legislative Power is vested in him: and he has the Right and his is the Duty to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.— These Rights and Duties, these Prerogatives and Dignities, are so transcendant, that they must naturally and necessarily excite in the Nation all the Jealousy, Envy, Fears, Apprehensions and Opposition, that is so constantly observed in England against the Crown.\nThat these Powers are necessary I readily Admit. That the Laws cannot be executed without them: that the Lives, Liberties, Properties and Characters of the Citizens cannot be Secure, without their Protection is most clear. But it is equally certain I think that they ought to have been Still greater, or much less.— The Limitations upon them, in the Cases of War, Treaties, and Appointments to Office and especially the Limitation, on the Presidents Independence as a branch of the Legislature, will be the destruction of this Constitution, and involve us in Anarchy, if not amended.— I shall pass over all these particulars for the present, except the last: because that is now the Point in dispute between You and me.\nLongitude and the Philosophers Stone, have not been sought with more Earnestness by Philosophers, than aGuardian of the Lawshas been Studied by Legislators from Plato to Montesquieu. but every Project has been found to be no better, than committing the Lamb to the Custody of the Wolf, excepting that one, which is calledA ballance of Power.— a Simple Sovereignty, in one, a few, or many has no ballance, and therefore no Laws. a divided Sovereignty without a ballance, or in other Words, where the division is unequal is alwaysat War, and consequently has no Laws. in our Constitution the Sovereignty, i.e the Legislative Power is divided, into three Branches. The House and Senate are equal, but the third Branch, tho essential is not equal.— The President must pass Judgment upon every Law—but in Some Cases his Judgment may be overruled. These Cases will be Such as attack, his constitutional Power, it is therefore certain he has not equal Power to defend himself, or the Constitution or the Judicial Power, as the Senate and House have.\nPower naturally grows.— Why? because human Passions are insatiable. but that Power alone can grow which is already too great, that which is unchecked. that which has no equal Power to controul it. The Legislative Power in our Constitution, is greater than the Executive, it will therefore encroach—because both Aristocratical and democratical Passions are insatiable.— The Legislative Power will increase, the Executive will diminish.— in the Legislature, the Monarchical Power is not equal, either to the Aristocratical, or democratical—it will therefore decrease, while the others will increase. indeed I think the Aristocratical Power is greater than either the Monarchical or Democratical. that will therefore Swallow up the other two.\nin my Letter of Yesterday, I think it was proved, that a Republic might make the Supream Executive an integral Part of the Legislature. in this it is equally demonstrated as I think, that our Constitution ought to be amended, by a decisive Adoption of that Expedient.\nif you dont forbid me, I shall write you again, / Yours sincerely\nJohn Adams"

Since their receipt to this time, I have been unusually employed on ajoint committee of the two houses, of Assembly, and in the Senate. But I lost not a moment in attending to your request respecting the rates of bricklayers in this town. Col: Nicholas, General Preston, & others, to whom I shewedyour letter of 19threferred me to MajrChristopher Tompkins of this place, as an undertaker in the Carpenter’s line, who could give me correct information in regard to the bricklayers of Richmond. I waited on MajrTompkins, and on shewing himyour letter, he assured me that he would, with the utmost pleasure, do any thing in his power to promote the welfare of the Central College, having a son whose education he wished to be finished at that place. It was needless, he observed, for me to accompany him; he would go promptly around to all the principal undertakers of brickwork in town, & bring me their terms. The enclosed letter presents the result of his enquiries: from which you will perceive that the rates here are very exorbitant, and that you cannot do better than to close with Brown. I believe you may confidently rely on MajrTompkins’s information. There are some 6 or 8 skilful workmen in Richmond; most of them have families, and all of them prefer working in town: each of them contracts for one million or one million & a half of bricks every year, and has more work offered than he can well attend to. The price of oil-stock brick, is exactlydouble of sand-stock. The workman who is willing to come up andmakebricks at $2 prm. he being found every thing, is namedNight, and is the brother of Night who worked on the College walls in November. He is said to be a better workman. I regret that I am unable to send you a more agreeable answer.\nThe Essays in the Enquirer, Bya Constituent, are certainly from the pen of MrGiles. They discover a mean and malignant spirit, and I am happy to hear they produce little or no effect.\nIt grieves me to tell you that I think our prospects are by no means flattering in the General Assembly. I shall not relax my small exertions in this noble cause. I hunt assiduously around me for every suggestion towards lessening the difficulties on the branch of the primary Schools. The hostile interests alluded to inmy last, have been constantly at work, and I believe they have produced some effect on the House of Delegates. My belief is, that with such a House of Delegates nothing can be done. I begin to cast my eyes over the state in pursuit of suitable persons to come in to the next. If I had the cooperation of some four or five men, such as I could describe, every thing could be effected. But I do not entirely despair.\nYour Letter of 31stwith the papers of MrPoinsot des Essarts, arrived this evening. They shall be faithfully attended to.\nMrWmBrent of Fairfax, to whom I wrote in the summer, in regard to the interests of the Central College in the upper counties of the northern neck, is now in Richmond: he was from home or would have answered the enquiries at an earlier day. He says nothing can be done in the way of subscription in that quarter. He will subscribe himself and send his sons to the College. His subscription is enclosed. MrCurrie has sent me similar information as to the lower counties of the northern neck. Chancellor Taylor will also subscribe.\nJoseph C. Cabell"

Three Hundred Mechanics who shall first settle in the Towns shall be each intitled to one Lott for ever.\nThis being too arduous an undertaking for us unconnected we propose forming a Company of twenty Shares each Share to consist of an undivided Ten thousand Acres which we will Sell at the rate of two Shillings ⅌ acre and demand only One Hundred Guineas ⅌ Share when the Patents Issue in the Companys NameOne Hundred Guineas twelve Months thereafter and the residue in three years.\nWhen the Company is form’d they May at their joint expence Send two Gentlemen of the Company to Europe with Ample powers to dispose of part of Said Lands and encourage Settlers[.] a Sale of an undivided One Hundred thousand Acres would undoubtedly throw a considerable balance into the hands of the Company and perhaps be effected before the Second payment becomes due.\nAdmit it sold as Low as 4/6 Sterling ⅌ Acre The company would have after paying us and other expences—£11000—=197 Farms of 500 Acres each—And about 4500 Town Lotts Half an Acre each.\nIt is needless to point out to a gentleman of your Excellencys information the probable advantages that may result from this Mode of Settlement not only to individuals but to the whole Western Country I will therefore only remark from my own observation this Summer at Greenbrier and from the Opinion of intelligent inhabitants of that Country that it bids fair to be one of the richest Settlements in the United States.\nShould your Excellency approve of our plan and think it deserving your encouragement I shall be happy in attending at any place that may be appointed to give a fuller explanation thereof and receive Such advice as your Excellency May please to honor me with.

This Morning a Number of them were coming in, but hearing of the Allarm, and all the Militia being orderd to Petersburg, they left the Worcks again.\nI have come this Evening to Town to see the County Lieutenant and see in what Manner this Affair can be settled.\nThe Militia of Prince George County are all orderd to assemble at this Place by the Governor, which is at the extreme of their County.\nIf they had been orderd to Blands Ordinary, their Worck at Hoods could have been carried on, agreable to the Governor’s Proposition, and if they Ennemies should move higher up the River, as where they are at present, these Militia can allways be time enough at Petersburg for any Service requisit. Non of the Men have assembled yet, and as the men now properly are under Your Orders, You may easily order it, if it meets with Your Aprobation.The County Lieut. Coll.

As long the Ennemy should not move higher up the River, then Burwells-Ferry, the best Situation for Genl. Muhlenberg would be at Cabbin point, and should the Ennemy move up, the Second may’d be to Blands-Ordinary and so to Petersburg.\nBut should we succeed in putting the Worcks at Hoods in some Defence, a good Position will be at the Head of Warts Creeck.\nShould they Ennemy move up the River, I think it will be necessary, to remove the Stores from Prince George Courthouse, if there are any, they may’d be in Danger.\nI was told to Day at Hoods for Certain, that they Ennemy had landed some Foot at Burwells Bay Church, a little below McKays house. And that their Vessels were only twelve in Number, if so, they certainly can’t do much. Tomorrow I shall return again to Hoods and continue my Worck, if you have no further Orders for me; but should be happy to have, as soon it was convenient to You, an Answer about the Militia of Prince George, that I may’d inform the County Lieutenant of it, what to do, by which means no time will be lost.\nI have the honour to be with the greatest Respect and Estime, Your most obedt and faithfull Servant\nSenf Coll.Engineer"

There yet remains some doubt relative to the event of the Action of the two fleets in the West Indies. Accounts from Martinique by different Channels and of a late date, appearing to render it dubious, whether Rodneys letter is spurious or real, we confess however, we have no expectation of its being the former; Yet there is great room to believe that the remainder of the French fleet will form a Junction with the Spanish at Cape François and that the Combined fleets will have a decided Superiority in the West Indies, which will enable them to proceed with the Expedition against Jamaica.\nWe find in a Report, the Superintendt. of Finance has made to Congress the Substance of his letter to you on the Subject of Stores, and have Since had a Communication with the minister of France on that Subject, who, informs us he answerd your letter, to him, relative thereto, and he hopes satisfactorily, but requested us to acquaint yourExcelly., “that the Misfortune which the Count de Guichens Convoy had met with, rendering it very difficult, for the Ministry to procure transports for the Supply of their own fleets and Armies and to bring out the Supplies orderd for the United States, he feard it would not be practicable to send out those which had been purchased for the State of Virginia in any short time.[”] He gave us to Understand that the transfer of the Debt from the State of Virginia to the United States had been a Misunderstanding of the Ministry, or some of the Under offices, & that it would be revoked and accommodated to all parties. we think however it would not be imprudent in the State of Virginia (if they wish soon to have those Stores[)], to provide transports for them and to obtain the same Convoy as those Vessels which are to bring out those belonging to the Un: States.\nThe Count de Beniousky having, renewd to us, an offer which has been made to Congress and not accepted as will be seen by the Enclosed papers No. 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5. We thought it a matter of too much Consequence not to transmit to your Excelly. which we have done, with copies of all the Papers, relative thereto, as above mentiond, which have been before Congress. It will rest with your Excelly. to consider the propriety of taking the Sense of the Legislature thereon. The terms offerd in the Paper No. 4 refer’s to those which have been made to Congress, which Yr. Excelly. will See in the Paper No. 1, and an explanation thereof in No. 2 after having been remarked upon by Genl. Washington. We have only to add on this Subject that the Gentleman who makes the offer does it as anIndividual. That he is a Polish Nobleman and a near relation to the late Count Pulasky. That a part of the troops he offers, and many of the officers (as he informs us) are such as have followd his fortunes in the Partition of that Kingdom. That Banishd from his own Country he professes a desire to become (with his followers) a Citizen of some one of these United States that he has recommendations, from the French Ministry, to their Minister here and has had his Countenance. The Rejection of his offer to Congress arose from a doubt in two or three of the States concerning the Propriety or policy of their being accepted byCongress. It is his desire that the offer made by him—if not accepted—may be kept as secret as possible, and that the answer thereto may be transmited, through us, with all possible expedition as he will be under a necessity of departing for Europe in the Course of three or four Weeks from this date—either to put himself in a state to Execute his proposals, or to take other steps with his troops, which are now in the Imperial Service, and willshortly be at his own charge—his desire of Secrecy and the Expedition with which Mr. Webb informs us he will travel has induced us to prefer a Conveyance by that Gentn. to one by the Post on this occasion.\nSince Writing the above Genl. Washington has informd Congress in a letter read yesterday, that he had received intelligence of some movements of the Enemy at New York which indicate a considerable embarkation, as upwards of 80 transports, under a strong Convoy had fallen down to the Narrows—in order as was supposed to take in a large body of troops—that the whole of the Regular troops had been reviewd—and a very large proportion of them were under Marching orders, for what purpose not known. we Submit to Yr. Excelly whether it would not be prudent, at least to be on our Guard notwithstanding the delusive appearances lately held out, at least not to relax in any preparations for carrying on the War.\nThe last post brought us no letter from Yr. Excelly[.] with the most perfect respect we are\nYr. Excellency’s Most obedt. Humbe Serts\nTheok. Bland Jr.\nJ. Madison Jr."

Continued Illness, with want of Information on the Subject, have occasioned the Delay in answering them.\nI have endeavour’d to learn what the Duties are that are payable bythe most favour’d Nationon the Exportation of Salt from France: I am at length told that the Duties are very low; that they consist chiefly in what is paid for the Forms or Papers necessary in transacting the Business regularly, and that they are equal on all Foreign Nations, and paid equally by all. If so we also must pay them. But you seem to think we have a Right to load Salt at Bordeauxfree of Duty:Perhaps you haveheard that there is some favour’d Nation which is allow’d that Right. Be so good as to enquire and obtain a Certainty of this, and an Account what the Duties are, and of the different Duties paid by different Nations, if there is any difference. When I am well acquainted with the Facts, I shall know whether I can by any Application to the Ministry be of Service to you, and I shall exert myself with a great deal of Pleasure in ascertaining your Rights: But if our Shipping of Salt free of Duties be not a Right, and must be asked as a Favor for particular Persons, which I apprehend you mean with regard to the Lading of the Buckskin, I find a Difficulty in doing this: For as we are obliged to be frequently requesting Aids of Money from the Government for ourPublic Uses, one cannot at the same time with any good Grace, desire, forprivate Persons, an Exemption in the Payment of those general Duties from whence only the Ability of granting such Aids must arise. I thank you for the Offer of conveying Dispatches in that Vessel, which I may possibly make Use of.\nI have the honor to be, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant.\nBFranklin\nMr McCreery Bordeaux."

I know that even an indifferent line is not unacceptable to your kindness.\nI entered Some time Since a course of chemical lectures—and was delighted by it as much as instructed; was I younger—and in a more affluent Situation, I Should devote all my strenght to it as no knowledge Seems to me more apt as this to develop and explain the wisdom of the creator—what an useful and interesting work might be performed by a enlightened Chemist, if he display’d by chemical experiments the intelligence of a first cause in all the operations and combinations of his works! when I was young I devoted a part of my time to this Study, but convinced ere long of the folly to grasp at everÿ thing, I abandoned it and threw myself entirely in the Study of the Public Law and that of my late Countrÿ—and was not unsuccessful—but alas! what avails me now this vain knowledge—what profit do I reap from these unrelented exertions?\nI have been thwarted in this new pursuit, to which I was encouraged by some professional frends by a relapse in head-ache—though less Severly than formerly, but preying more on my Spirits, and have resolved to make an excursion—for a few days—with my Dear Daughter—to Oneÿda Lake—to bid a last farewel to a respectable frend Mrs Barnhard—who is persuaded—on the decision of her Physician, that this year Shall be her last—and Submits without reluctance with a calm resignation—Her wishes are accomplished—She enjoÿs independence and affluence—which they had before by birth and from family—thro her own and her husbands and only son’s unexampled industrÿ—while befor she lived and was educated in the first circle of high life—She has seen her Son married—in a respectable family—Bloomfield—and does not wish to protract her journey here. I was not there in three years—and She desires to see us once more—particularly my Daughter. I nearly envy her lot, and find it a difficult task—to learn to Submit, and wait—till we are called in our Turn—Must I make an apologÿ for mÿ manner of corresponding? in that case I must not have written—I must have forgotten, that I did write to mÿ venerable frend—your Ladÿ Soothed my Sorrows in the absence of mrs v. d. k—and you Succeeded—in making me participate in the happiness She enjoy’d at Philadelphia—But you must feel—as you my friend—what it is to be interested in domestic Scenes of bliss—to paint these with Such vivid colours.\nI must have expressed myself very incorrectly—which happens more—and against my design—if I penned—that I was a dissenter from you in Politics and Religion—my intention was to Saÿ, that I trusted So much in your indulgence and candour, of which I had So many proof, that although we differed in Speculative opinions in Politics and religion, it would be of no more consequence, than if it related to Philosophical and Literarÿ pursuits.\nIn politics—generally spoken—I owe you, what I know—and revere you as my master—although I might differ in opinion about our Situation, and the conduct of our Rulers—and here yet, I maÿ err and grope in the dark. Our Religious creed, I believe, is verÿ much in unison—mine is not altered in forty years—and formed—upon a plain rule—believing I must Say convinced, of the historical truth of Christianity—it seemed to me if it was a revelation of a good and wise Being—an honest—uninstructed mind—the meanest man with a Sound head and Sincer heart, must be able to discover So much of its truth—to be the rule of his conduct and happiness—I perused thus the Scriptures—and did not care about that, which I did not understand—at a first attentive perusal—renewed this inquiry in that manner again and again—and was confirmed in a Simple doctrine and lately renewed it again without any new discoveries.\nI thank God with you of having been placed in the blessed abode I thank him for our elegant—useful and noble frame and limbs—I thank him to have given us an assurance of an immortal existence and praÿ fervently—that—my weeknesses and follies notwithstanding I maÿ be mercifully favoured—to be replaced in the society of those I loved and respected, in what ever low degree it were—to learn and improve from their exalted example. The absence from them—although finally conducive to happiness—would be a severe punishment—and even a following rejoinder—an inferior degree of attained perfection, with a vivid Sense, that a superor excellence had been placed within my reach—would remain eternally a matter of regret—which recollection must give more or less bitter pangs.\nYou did not expect, my Dear Adams! to hear again from your beloved and respected frend—I knew—the communication would be delightful—it was a sauf conduit for my Letter—ah—Adams!—my heart is Sadly wounded—I can not write it without tears—that frend—de Gyzelaer is no more!—He died the 30 Maÿ—In april—he send me word—with Some Books—to write me ere long—and his last Letter—of which I give you notice, was the warmest efusion of his noble heart, I ever received—I answered him directly—which alas! Shall never reach him, but <I would> maÿ be balsam in the wounds of his amiable and excellent Daughter—you, who loved and respected him, will feel for me—will pity me—two more of my frends are remaining—and both older as I am—De gyzelaer was 64—Our intimacy begun in 1774—at the university, and was as ardent in our declining years—as in the days of our youths—One of the best men of that Countrÿ is gone—I Shall bewail my loss, and regret, that your friend Everett can not reap the benefit of my Introductory Lett—in this respect too my endeavours to do good—to be usefull have been in vain.\nI remain / your obliged frend\nFr.

It is in vain to endeavor to describe the situation of my mind; it would pour balm neither into your wounds nor mine; I will therefore pass on from the subject. I wrote you by the last packet, of Jan. 13th, on the subject of the money which had been voted me by the Assembly. I find now, by your letter, that it cannot be reserved for the purpose I had in contemplation, and therefore wish you to call for and apply it as shall be mostrequisite, should Mr. Madison not have used it as I offered to him. When I look over the list of my debts as they stood at my departure from Virginia, and consider that Key has had the crop of 1783, and by this time that of 1784, I cannot but hope that with the aid abovementioned from the treasury, all very urging claims may be satisfied. I have a lot in Richmond, by the waterside, bought of Col. Byrd, to the sale of which I should have no objection; the purchaser undertaking to obtain the title from Mr. Carter, which has never yet been completely done. Europe presents nothing new. We are still hanging between peace and war, as heretofore, unable to conjecture which will take place. The depredations of the piratical States on our commerce is the most interesting circumstance to us. This can only be prevented by war or tribute. If the latter, it will not be light. Mr. Short is here, and well. Patsy enjoys perfect health; but I cannot recover mine. I am, however, so much better than I have been that I hope soon to be well. Perhaps this gloomy and damp climate may disappoint my hopes. Present me affectionately to Mrs. Eppes, who will kiss my dear, dear Polly for me. Oh! could I do it myself! Give our love, also, to the children, and be assured of the sincerity with which I am, dear sir, Your affectionate friend and servant,\nTh. Jefferson\nP.S. I must beg the favor of you never to send a letter by any conveyance but the French packet. If your letters leave Richmond by the first of the month, addressed to the care of Neill Jamieson, in New York, they will reach that in time to come by the packet of that month; and we are sure of receiving them, submitting only to their being privately read by the postmaster, as is the case in every country in Europe; should there at any time be anything which ought not to be read by any other, it will be necessary to desire Mr. Jamieson to confide it to some passenger who will put it into my own hand. By the French packet I shall receive your letters in seven weeks from their date."

I shall be olbiged to attend the County Court at Fairfield on Tuesday next the 19th inst., when I shall depend on having the particular of Thompson’s present Situation accurately delineated.

As the Price is so high, I am not very much disappointed at the Want of Ingredients: As to the Seal, we shall take it very kind of you to forward it as soon as convenient. The Money shall be paid by a Bill without Delay. Opportunities to Richmond probably are much more frequent than to this Place, & will answer nearly as well.\nIt appears, I think now, that the principal Stumbling Block is removed. The Commission you mention, certainly promises a Solicitude on the Part of Britain, at least, for Negotiation, if it has not in Fact; given up the grand Point for wh. we contend. No Country ever stood more in Need of Peace than this. Virginia, wh. ought by Nature, & wh. a Peace will prove it to be, the most flourishing of the Union, is now almost a sapless Trunk. Our Money continually drained from among us, centers elsewhere, we have not eno’ for common purposes, & even this little is every Day growing less & less. But, I fear, from a Copy of a late Letter wh. is now generally circulated, that Obstacles to Peace will still arise, wh. the unsuspecting did not foresee. The Authority upon wh. it rests, is that of our public Ministers abroad. It’s Contents are now no Secret to the World. They are in the Mouth of every Body, & whether true or not, seem to have excited a general Alarm.\nA Question was asked by the Author of the Letter before alluded to, before a Committee of the House, & a large Concourse of Strangers, was asked too of a Member of C. itself, “Do you not know that aMajorityof C. are under the Influence of the French Minister?” If this really be the Case, perhaps Peace, and even honle. Peace, will in vain hold out the Olive to America herself. I hope however that you are not under this Influence. If you are, the World does you great Injustice, for you are not even suspected. But it was certainly a curious Question, considering from whence it came & to whom it was directed, & withall the Occasion on wh. it was proposed. You know probably the Circumstances wh. called forth all this Matter allud[ed to] in our Assembly. If you do not, I do not feel myself disposed to enter into a Detail, as I am sure, it wd give you little Satisfact[ion.] It may serve howeverhereafter for the curious Retailer of historical Affairs to make many sage Reflections upon.\nI once more take the Liberty to inclose a Letter in yours. I would not omit answering one recd from Dr Coste, & it appeared the best Channel to forward it to him, as you probably have frequen[t] Communication with the F. Army. I shall not however make a practice of this, nor even now shd not impose[?] it, but that I apprehended, it wd. not otherwise get to him.\nMany friends here wish you all Happiness & no one more sincerely than\nJ.M.\nIf the Doct has left Ama. the Letter may be burnt—"

If so they must still wait.\nYour several packets and letters for America I enclos’d under one Cover to Mr. Jay, presuming in the probability of the Gentlemen being all at N. York. They are on board the Betsey Capt. Mesnard who left the Downs for N. Y. the 25th. Febry. with a fair Wind which has continued ever since. He was one of the two first Ships who saild together for that part of America after I receivd your Commands.\nI have receiv’d Five pounds from Mr. Shippen agreeable to your Letter of Jany. 12th.\nI have also to acknowledge your letters of the 5th. and 15th. Febry. with their enclosures. That to Mr. Jay makes one of my packet to him. That to Mrs. Church I deliver’d. She left London for Falmouth the 1st of this month, to go on board the Packet:—I hope she has not yet sail’d as the Weather is extremely blowing and squally yesterday and today.\nI am heartily sorry for the strange accounts which we have of the Count Du M. I had hints some time since which I wishd not to believe, but I find them confirm’d by the unanimous report of every person from the Country: nothing would have more surpriz’d me, as I thought him the man of all others to be well receiv’d.\nI have given your Commission for the three pictures:—but I cannot say I think you will like the arrangement you propose when you see it executed:—The blank spaces between the three ovals will have a very awkward look. Besides that the whole willbe unweildy either to transport or to hang:—I should certainly have them seperate and of the common size and distinguish the three by the manner of hanging them.—I have order’d the copyist to go on with only one of the heads untill I have your answer.\nDr. Gordon desires me to ask whether you have receiv’d six setts of his books, which He forwarded to you by the Diligence early in December and whether the Marquis La Fayette receiv’d 12 setts at the same time.—He will likewise thank you to hint to the M. in the most delicate manner, that the subscription has not been fulfill’d. I have reason to Suppose that the Doctors situation in point of finance is not altogether desireable, and therefore even this small sum will be particularly acceptable just now.\nGreat preparations are making throughout the City for most splendid illuminations tomorrow evening on the occasion of his Majesty’s recovery, which is to [be] announc’d tomorrow by his Message to the two Houses of Parliament, reassuming the Management of public Affairs. Joy on the occasion appears to be very general. I am most respectfully & faithfully Your Oblig’d Servant & friend,\nJno.Trumbull"

Resolved, that Congress agree to the said Report.\nAt a Brigade Court-Martial in the Corps of Artillery Augt 14th 1778—Lieutt Coll Popkin President, Lieutenant Waters and McNamara were tried for speaking disrespectfully of the Commander in Chief treating Lieutt Hill in a scandalous manner unbecoming the Characters of Gentlemen & raising a Riot, and contemptuous treatment of Coll Harrison after being arrested —After mature deliberation the Court are of opinion that Lieutenant Waters is guilty of treating Mr Hill in a scandalous manner, unbecoming the Character of a Gentleman, but as the provocation from Mr Hill was so considerable and so very apt to produce in Mr Waters the forgetfulness of his Character as a Gentleman and Officer, they view the Crime in some measure palliated & therefore only sentence him to be reprimanded by the Commanding Officer of Artillery in Presence of all the Officers of the Corps—The General approves the sentence & orders it to take place tomorrow morning at Roll-Call.\nThe Court find Lieutt McNamara of Colonel Harrison’s Regiment of Artillery guilty of speaking disrespectfully of His Excellency General Washington, treating Lieutt Hill in a scandalous manner, unbecoming the Character of a Gentleman & contemptuous treatment of Coll Harrison after being arrested and unanimously adjudged that he shall be cashiered.\nThe Commander in Chief is sorry to be under the Necessity of Decidingin a Case of this Nature & would readily remit the sentence against Lieutt McNamara if his behaviour to Colonel Harrison, his Commanding Officer had not been so gross and disorderly as to compel the General to confirm it.\nThe General Court-Martial whereof Major General Lincoln is President will sit tomorrow at the time and Place mentioned in yesterdays orders—Members the same, except Coll WyllysviceColl Cortland who is absent on Command."

States, notwithstanding the various efforts that have been made to debauch them. They have consented that the line of limits should be run, (with an exception by Little Turtle) agreeably to the Treaty of Greenville and the surveyers have accordingly commenced the work under the countenance of a small military guard.\nThe Creeks appear also to be well disposed, and affairs in Tenesee to wear a favourable aspect.\nThe Commissioners who are engaged in establishing the boundary line between the Cherokees and the U. States, have proceeded to run the course 40 miles above Nashville where they have stopped, till they can make some experiments necessary to ascertain whether if continued, it would touch the river called for in the treaty of Holston. By their last letters of the 5th & 12th of July they were on their way to the Kentucky trace in Cumberland, to run the line from thence to Clinch and thence across the Holston to the S. Carolina Indian boundary on the North Carolina line. Here they proposed to halt till they had ascertained and marked every part of the line where intrusions might be apprehended within the present year.\nLt. Col. Butler arrived with his command at Nashville on the 22 June, and on the 27th had advanced 32 miles in approaching Knoxville. This movement has been conducted satisfactorily and without accident. Cap.[Ransalairs]company of Dragoons reached Knoxville on the 5th July in good order, having performed a march from Fort Washington to that place in one month without the loss of either man or horse.\nThis detachment, I expect, will fully answer the several important objects for which it was intended. Mr. Hawkins writes that “the arrival of these troops have a happy effect in disposing the minds of the people to submit to the laws.\nNo information has been received from the East bank of the Mississippi since your leaving this City.\nI flatter myself that Mrs. Adams and you have arrived safe at Braintree, and that these accounts will not lessen your pleasure.\nWith the most sincere respect I have the honour to be / Sir your most obt\nJames McHenry"

Jupiter came over to me yesterday evening—he says there has never been the smallest mark about the Door or lock, of the room having been entered by anyone. I think it possible the villain may have contrived to get loose that part of the lock into which the bolt of it enters & have replaced it carefully so as to give it exactly the same appearance: I am confident however but little mischief can have been done, for if any thing curious or valuable had been taken it must have been seen about the person as those things were which gave rise to the suspicion: his stupidity w’d. have prevented his concealing it I am certain. Three or 4 days before I heard of this affair, I observed a Negroe with a gun skulking about my yard just at the close of day I went out immediately and seized him it proved to beYorkwho had been some time here for a wound he got in his arm from a knife in an affray at Mont’o.; which I had cured & had returned him to George some time. The gun exciting suspicion I had him searched; one pair &an odd stocking marked T.I. were upon him a copy ofBrackensFarriery & a pen-knife: which might all have been obtained elsewhere than in your room for my people remembered some of your stocki[ngs ha]ving been stolen from the wash house and the bo[ok was] not one, I thought, of your library. The gun I suspect to be yours but cannot positively decide being familiar only with the Pistoias. I find myself mending fast and hope tomorrow to ride to Mont’o. to have the door properly secured. By next post I shall be able to inform you fully on this affair.\nWill you do me the favor to get 6 panes of Glass 16⅜ by 14¼ for Martha’s bookcase?

Defends his motives for seeking a position and admits that the emolument is a concern “in a country where the expences of life are beyond those here and where public duties of any kind still increase that expence.” As a merchant, has experienced losses during the last four years, but maintains it is the duty of everyone “to submit to those measures which the public interests require.”"

I wish you had sent me a Poor Richard’s Almanack. It is impossible to form any Judgment yet when I shall return; but hope it may be early in the Summer.\nI am oblig’d to Dr. Evans for the Journal. Lord Anson heard I had such a Thing, and sent for it to day. Say nothing of this.\nThis Nation has been almost in Despair, on Account of their bad Success everywhere during this Year; but the King of Prussia’s late good Fortune begins to revive them again. He will have a great Sum granted him by Parliament. Just now we have the News, that Prince Bevern has gain’d a compleat Victory over the Austrians in Silesia. They were double his Number, tis said, and attack’d him in his Camp, thinking to force his Intrenchments; but after 4 hours bloody Conflict, they gave over the Attempt; he came out and attack’d them in his turn, the Austrians broke and fled three different Ways; he pursu’d 6 German Miles, came up with one Third, and cut them to pieces; the King, who was marching to his Assistance met another Division, and demolish’d that. How much of this will prove true I know not: But that there has been a Victory is generally believ’d.\nMy Love to Polly and the Children, Mrs. Leacock, &c. in which Billy joins.

Chase Master, to Enter the Port of Havanna.—The week past we had, by a special messenger, that we had sent on to Philadelphia, with the required, authenticated certificates, the honour of receiving, from His Excellency Don Joseph de Jandenes a polite Letter accompanyed with his Permission for sd. ship &ce &ce.\nThe Owners of the Ship are convinced, that through your kind influenceonly, the grant was obtained, and desire me in their Names, to return You, their thanks of gratitude, joined with my peculiar obligations to you sir for this favour.\nYou very truely observe, that many of our Contemporaries are droping off. One of my Collegues Mr. Deshon & the Continental Agent Mr. Bradford are in the number. And my much honoured Friend the Cheif Majestrate of Massachusetts, whom I had the pleasure of taking by the hand, in July last at Boston, seems to be very feeble & fast approximating to his dissolution. We are all of us, making room for Posterity to conduct the affairs of this mighty Republic: I hope a propicious Providence, will grant them Wisdom & every Virtue, to Govern the extensive Dominions and increasing Inhabitants of the United States of America.\nI feel my self willing to depart, could I have the satisfaction of imbracing my Son, that Imbarked with You & under your countenace, in the Ship Boston for France in the Year 1778, the many unmerited benefits, that he received, by your notice of him, I have a grateful sense of. But! alas! he yet remains in that distracted Country: I cannot prevail with him to return, by every indearing Parental soothing or harsh menaces. Doctr. Franklin, Mr Jefferson, Marquis la Fayatte, Mr Short & many others, have indeavoured to prevail with to return to America, where he might be useful to his Country.—Doctr. Franklin, before he left France Wrote him a Letter, and inserted upon his returning with him, and if he was imbarrassed in his Finances, to let him know the amount, and he would find means to discharge them. He did not answer his Letter, but ever after shuned his House.—The Doctr. upon his arrival at Philada. inclosed me a copy of the Letter, and advised me in the strongest terms, to cross the Atlantic, and he would furnish me with the means of forceing him away: for he was a subject, worth saveing; as he did not know of any vice, that he was guilty of: and it would be his ruin to remain—\nAt my time of Life, and not having had the small Pox, detered me from going, and has rendered my Life extreemly unhappy, in being deprived of a Son for Seventeen Years, that I had hopes of being a consolation & not a grief in Old Age.\nMr. Short prevailed with him Three years past, to leave Paris & go to Bordeaux & Imbark for America, which he promised to perform immediately, but has remained there to this day.\nThe fascinating manners, customs and habits of France, has made such an impression upon his Mind, that he abandons his Country, Parent, an only Brother, Friends & connexions, to gratify, a mistaken Pleasure & happiness, and even to forego the prospect, of ever receiving a farthing of my Estate, (which he well knows) unless he returns before my decease\nI beg Sir, you will excuse, this long dis-interesting Letter and believe me, with sentiments of purest truth & sincere regards.\nYour most Obedient / and most Humble servt.\nWm.

    "content": "Museum Octr 11th. 1801.\nDear Sir\nYour favour of the 29th. July I did not receive until I had reached the place of bones, when I should have been pleased to have answered it, had it been possible or proper to have taken my attentions from engagments so earnest & constant. The use of a powerfulPumpmight have saved me 50 or 60 Dollars expence, but perhaps the obligation to return one belonging to the Public in a limited time, might not have been altogather convenient—for, contrary to my expectation my stay was longer, and labours much greater than I had contemplated when I planed the Journey. Accept my thanks foryour intention to serve me, and permit me to give a short account of my progress and success.\nI carried with me up thenorth riverone common Pump and contemplated getting others, or devising such other means, on a review of the grounds ajacent to theMorass, as might then appear best.\nThe field bordering on the Morass where the Bones were found, being covered with Grain on my former Visit, prevented me from seeing a Bason which seemed to be formed exactly for my purpose; Sufficiently large to receive all the water in the ponds where the Bones lay, not more than 100 feet distant. When I ascended a nole of the stubble field and discovered the Bason, The Idea instantly occured of a chain of Buckets carried round an axis, pouring the lifted Water into a Trough communicating to the Bason.\nThe Power of raising the weight of which, Obtained by awheelof 20 feet diameter, of a width for men to walk within, as a Squirril in a Cage.\nThis design was soon executed in the simplest manner, the Buckets made of boards nailed togather, suspended between two ropes tyed into a great number of knots, to prevent their sliping in the Pully—a strong Rope served as a band to drive the axis, for carrying the Buckets. This Machinery, when mooved by 2 or 3 men walking slowly, raised, according to a moderate calculation, 1440 Gallons of Water every hour, and thus I was enabled to emty the Ponds and keep them free of Water, while the men remooved the Mud.\nThis we conceived was an important object, as the Water came from powerful springs, so intensely cold, as rendered it almost impossible for men to bear the effect of it for any length of time.\nHaving accomplished this part of the labour, we supposed on remooving the Mud and uncovering the Bones, we should see how they lay, and take them up leisurely—however the task was not so easy, and other difficulties came upon us; the banks, after the support of the Water was remooved, cracked and mooved forward, and obliged us to drive Piles &c.\nThe obtaining all the bones belonging to one Animal was an important object and therefore I neither spared labour nor expence, yet the great debth of the Morass, with a bottom descending in an Angle of 45 degrees, some of the large Bones after being disjointed by the farmers when they made their rude attemps to pull them up, have as I suppose slid forward into the deep parts of the Morass—for I could not get the second Tusk and aFemur. Yet I was so fortunate as to find so many pieces of the Tusk which was broken and part of it taken upbefore, that the size and form is accurately assertained—the length nearly eleven feet, very much curved; nearly to a semi-circle, with a moderate spiral—The form beautiful as infinite varied circles & spirals can make it. Although I could not get all the Bones of the feet, yet with the number in possession, and carving some counter parts, I have now nearly compleated them before and behind—by which a knowledge of its feet is now obtained. Several pieces which I got of the under Jaw, prooved that it was broken so much as to loose its Value, and although I got many pieces of the upper head, and shall put all togather in the most careful manner, yet the form of the skull will be deficient. I obtained a part of theSternumor breast bone; all the Vertebraes, and part of theos Sacrum, all the ribs—aTibia&fibulaor lower part of the hind leggs which was wanting before—besides many small pieces of bones, which carfully put togather, with some inconsiderable additions of Carved pieces, will render this a tolerable compleat Skeleton. Being disappointed of getting all I wanted of this first Skeleton, I determined to try some other morasses, where some few bones had before been found, I went to aMorass 16 miles distant, from this, only three Ribs had been taken up—Here I obtained 43 bones of the feet, 10 tail bones, 2 Tusks, many Ribs, some Vertebres, and a Blade bone.\nI found these bones scattered in every direction, and some of them buried between large stones, & even under them, tho’ the Stones that covered them were not large. After diging about 40 feet square, and spending about 8 or 9 days of several mens labour—I went to another Morass, 5 miles furthur where several bones had been taken up—but as no part of the Head had been found, my hopes were particularly to obtain that part. Here I found the Bones more scattered than at the last place—This part of the Morass was not so deep as those I had explored before. After finding a number of ribs and some few bones of the feet—and having dug up manure to a very considerable distance round, in the moment when dispairing of getting any more bones, and thinking to discharge the labourers—By means of aspearwhich we used, we luckily discovered other Bones—which uncovered prooved to be a fore leg, beneath which was an intire under Jaw not a part deficient, except one of the lesser grinders, which appears to have been lost while the Animal lived. here also we found part of a foot. from this spot to where we found the heal of the hind foot measured 82 feet. After exploring in every direction, at last found the upper head, but in such total decay, that no part would hold togather except the enamel of the Grinders, and that part which joins the neck. The place the Skull once occupied appeared to be a littleblacker than other parts of the mud—Theformin part was discoverable, although all was converted into manure—yet it would seperate & shew the rounded parts.\nAll the Morasses where these Bones have been found, have marly Bottoms. Bones found in the whitest shell-marle, are most perfect, those parts found in a bluesh coloured marle, less so, and bones found in the black marles, generally in total decay.\nThe experience I have had, enables me to judge with certainty; several bones we have found, exhibits these facts in the clearest point of view. The Shell-marle it is probable possesses much anticeptic qualities—The Spring water is also essential to the preservation of the bones—I have brought specimens of the several strata where these Bones are found, and DoctrWoodhousehas promised to analize them for me.\nWhen I undertook this journey, I was under considerable apprehension of subjecting myself to putrid or bilious fever—by exposing to a hot Sun, a great quantity of rotten Vegetables, also with the addition of much stagnant Water—and although the weather was extremely hot, and some of the morasses and Ponds were surrounded by woods that prevented the passage of the winds, yet we enjoyed good health, perhaps the precautions I used in a great measure guarded our health—but I am much inclined to beleive, that those morasses are not so unhealthy as many people have immagined—For many Gentlemen of that Country marveled how I could enjoy health undergoing such fateague. The Bones found in that country are not petrefied like many found on the ohio, yet in the vicinity of those morasses we found immense quantities of Petrefactions of Shells and even nuts—and what I thought extraordinary near the last place we explored, we found a considerable quantity of petrefied corals, some of which are large. I do not find any Saltness in the taste of substances found in these morasses, but on the contrary, the Water which we took from the Springs was the most pure and agreable that I ever meet with; it was so clear as not to impede the sight of the bottom of the deepest Vessel that held it.\nWhen we take a view of the mountains through which the north River passes, the Idea naturally occurs, that probably once those waters were damed up by those Mountains, and thuse formed a great Lake from thence to the Shawangunk mountain, such I find has been the oppinion of many.\nAs my wheel buckets and other Machinery excited the curiosity of all the people of that part of the country, I was visited by crouds of all sexes and ages. Among the croud one day I observed avenerable old man, upon enquiry I found he was a native & Inhabitant of the neighbourhood, that he was also inteligent, and a man of veracity—He told me that he was well aquainted with the Indians before they left that part of the Country—That those Indians had a tradition among them, which was particularly told him in 1754 by an Inteligent Indian (John Paulen) about 50 or 60 years of age—That formerly the whole of the land between the Shawangunt mountain and the north River, was covered with Water, that when the water subsided, it left large Ponds in many places, and that these Ponds gradually dried up and became morasses. The general appearance of the lands in the neighbourhood of these morasses favour such an opinion, they are in small round hills, as if thrown into those forms by the agitation of Waters.\nBut to leave conjectures, and return to the Bones, The quantity we collected at the two last explored Morasses, with those that had been before taken, which we have also obtained, will enable my son Rembrandt by the aid of his Chizil to carve in wood all the deficiences in order to compleat a second Skeleton, with which he hopes to pay his expences of traveling into Europe. He has long wished to improve his talents in painting, and I am happy to have it in my power to aid him, more especially as by the Exhibition of it, there is a chance of his making something handsome and at the same time to make an exchange of the duplicate subjects I possess, for those of Europe, yet wanting in my Museum, besides settling a good and sure correspondence for a reciprocal exchange of Natural Subjects—It is supposed that a great deal of money may be made in London & Paris with such a Skeleton, but I am taught not to be so sanguine in my expectations—If he can meet all his expences, and take the Portraits of distinguished charactors in the large Cities of Europe, and gain more knowledge with a small addition to his Purse, it will be well. The first Skeleton might soon be erected in the Museum, but the necessity of keeping it apart until my Son has made up the deficiences of the 2d Skeleton, will be a cause of some delay.\nDoctr Wistar has been so obliging as to aid me with his knowledge in the disposition of the bones, and he is now determining the enalegy of the feet of this Animal & the Elephant.\nHaving now given a detail of what I conceive to be the most interesting on this occasion, I shall only add, that it is my intention to explore other places, as soon as I have leisure, and season and opportunity shall be most favorable. Having borrowed some money from thePhilosophical Society, which with what I collected elsewhere, was sufficient to pay all my expences, this I am fully satisfied, will bereturned to me as soon as the exhibition of this Skeleton is opened, when I shall be enabled to fulfill all my engagments. Therefore with the present prospect it is not necessary to gain other pecuniary aid—my Museum under its present Visitations, supplies the common exigences of the family, and a little more by our frugality, to enable me to pursue some of my plans of improvements that are not very expensive, therefore permit me to return you my most cordial thanks for your kind intention of serving your much obliged friend and Humble Servant\nC W Peale\nPS. Having made aPetition to Spain, some months ago, for liberty to collect subjects of Natural History in South America. The Spanish Minister called on me yesterday, to inform me that he had his orders to permit me to exploreall South America, and also to defray the expence of Cariage of those articles intended for theCabinetof Madrid."

The usage is, to allow a certain time to the subscribers (ordinarily from three to six months) to pay in the sums subscribed, the sums paid in, in each month, bearing interest from the beginning of the month. The Schedule No. II, shews the monthly periods of actual payment. The first of these loans was set on foot by our Bankers in Holland, without previous authority, for reasons of weight, respecting the interests and credit of the United States. A due regard to the motives, and considerations relative to the yet unascertained effect of our financial arrangements in their first stages led to an acceptance of that loan on account of the government. The fourth of these loans was originally contracted for three millions of florins, but nine hundred and fifty thousand florins were afterwards suppressed, in consequence of its being found, that money had become obtainable at a lower rate of interest.\n(B) The conversion of florins into livres, in each case, is regulated by the actual market rate of exchange, at the time of payment. It is, however, understood, that there is to be a reliquidation, with a view to certain equitable considerations. The rate of exchange, for the proceeds of the Antwerp loan, is stated by analogy—no more certain rule being, at present, in possession of the Treasury.\n(C) The actual payment of this interest is not yet known at the Treasury, but an appropriation has been made for it, at the disposal of the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States in France.\n(D) Advice is received, that this payment was going on, though it had not been completed. There is no cause to doubt, that it has been since carried into full effect.\n(E) The produce of the Bills drawn for this sum, and others particulars respecting it, will appear from the Schedules, No. III and IV.\nAccording to the terms of all these loans, the United States are bound to reimburse, in fifteen years, by equal instalments, the first beginning the eleventh year; but the United States have reserved a right upon all, except the two last, to reimburse, at any time, at their pleasure; The reimbursement of the two last (according to the general usage of the country, observed in all loans by the United States, prior to the present government) cannot begin ’till the eleventh year.\nAlex.

I have sent your Bank book, &c, as you desired, and have not yet hear’d any thing from Osgood.\nMr. Shaw was here to day, and took George to meeting and to pay several visits, where he made him read french; I do not like to refuse Shaw, but I fear it will be of no service to the Child, as he already possesses a degree of Vanity, very unusual in a child of his age, and it makes him fancy that he has already learnt enough—I am sorry to say that I much fear, he will not benefit from my instructions, he having sense enough to draw comparisons, between your skill and mine, in the art of tuition—however I will do my best, and if he loses, you must make due allowance. John can repeat la Cigale, he is very anxious to get the Rocking Horse.\nDecbr. 9th.\nI have just recieved your letter, my beloved friend, but cannot concieve why you sent it to Quincy. most sincerely was I rejoiced to learn, that Col. S. was in New York, as it was here confidently asserted, that he had gone to the westward, which caused great anxiety to your family—\nYour journey must have been amusing, at least, if as we are told, “variety is charming.” it would however, have been much more so, had your very pleasant companion not quitted you so early. but beingfree, andunshackledas you now are, must certainly add considerably to your enjoyment.\nWe go on here as well as I expected, Sally however could not support the what she termed,horrorsof the situation. after quitting me, and living one week with Mrs. G. (who promised her 9 Shillings a week, and gave her[. . .]6) went of to Quincy, where she expects to live with your Mother. She has however condition’d to return to me, in the Spring. I have got a very good Girl from Groton, and I believe I shall be a gainer by the exchange. Caroline has been very sick but is now much recover’d.\nI have been visited by a few ladies, Mrs. George Blake sat with us near an hour. your Brother & Sister were in Town yesterday, and your father came to see us last Saturday was a week. we spent thanksgiving alone, it was a very disagreeable day, by the by, the Seats are so very high at Lowels meeting house, I have not ventured to take one.

Phila., also a tin box containing the seed of the bread tree mentioned in your letter, only that there were four instead of two Seeds. Accept my sincere thanks for this communication and be assured no attention shall be wanting on my part to render your benevolent intentions successful. If they could be raised for two or three years in a Greenhouse and then in the Spring of the Year turned into the full ground, I should make no doubt raising them, but I have no Greenhouse, and must therefore do the best I can without one. Whatever may be the issue, I am bound to acquaint you with the progress of this experiment to add this valuable plant to the list of our cultivated Vegetables. As I have long known your ardent wishes for the ease and happiness of your fellow Citizens, I have frequently asked the Gentlemen from your State whether the Teffe or Ensette had been raised, or any attempt made to do it at Monticello? The answer has always been in the Negative. This has surprized me as I knew you had Correspondents both in France and England; where I suppose these plants have been raised, as Mr. Bruce gave liberally of the seeds to both Kingdoms. Perhaps the Teffe is the most valuable acquisition that could be made for the lower parts of Virga. and the Southern States. As it is an annual and reaped like other small grain, there can be no doubt but it would grow any where in the Southern States, and as the Seed is protected by a Capsule I should hope it would escape the Weavil which renders the raising wheat so precarious. As to the Ensette I have not the same hopes, but think it might be cultivated probably as we do the Tannier, which I suppose the same plant that Cap. Cook found in the Islands of the South Sea, and called by the Natives Taro. This does not appear to me to be a name given it by the Natives, but by the Spaniards, and is a corruption of the word Arum of which this plant is a Species. Be this as it may it grows here in great vigour and is avaluable addition to our esculents. The roots are planted in April in hills three feet apart, they are sown twice or rather hilled twice and taken up in the fall and preserved like potatoes, and those who are accustomed to this root prefer them much to any kind of Potatoes. Our Success with this plant which is a native of the hottest parts of Africa induces me to think we might also raise the ensette. I hope we shall before long hear of Peace in Europe, and then the means of communication will be both frequent and safe, when I wish you would add to the favours you have already done the Public, the introduction of the Seeds of those two plants if to be had. Surely nothing can be so gratifying to an enlightened mind as adding to the felicity of your fellow Citizens by increasing the means of Subsistence. I shall make no apology for this long letter and the Hints in it, but that you have drawn it on yourself, by writing to an old man on his favourite Subject, and I verily believe we must have our hobby’s as long as we live. Believe me with the most Sincere Respect & Esteem Sir Yr Mo. Ob. Hum. Sert.\nAllenJones"

Bellanger enclosed in his to Mr. Randolph, which informs him that M. Le Roy of Bordeaux had died and left him a legacy of 15,000₶. This makes him happy once more and he hopesthe measures he will take will provide a solid establishment. In her letter of 14 Apr. Mde. Bellanger informed him she had written his uncle, M. Plumard at Nantes, to obtain this sum in the hands of the executor and dispatch it to him as soon as possible. At the request of the family, he sent a power of attorney to him, but it lacked the seal of the state. He has had a new one made and Mr. Randolph, who goes to Richmond tomorrow, will have the seal affixed.—He asks TJ to write a line to his uncle to point out the best and quickest way for him to receive the legacy, whether by a bill to TJ’s order on Philadelphia or Richmond as he thinks best for safety and speed.—If, however, TJ thinks Fenwick at Bordeaux would be the most proper person, he offers full power of attorney for him to act, fearing the mishaps that might occur. He leaves open the letter to his uncle for TJ to read and to forward only if he thinks the measures taken are the best.—He asks TJ to inform Mazzei of his legacy. Mde. Bellanger, for reasons he will explain when he sees TJ, says that she did not mention it to him; that she sees little of him; that he appears entirely occupied “de ses Grandeurs, de ses Equipages et de ses domestiques.” Mazzei’s interest in Derieux and his family seems to diminish as his credit rises and if he is not yet at the crest, he will no doubt entirely forget them. He has written Mazzei several letters and he has not answered any in more than two years.—All his life he will be grateful to TJ for repeated good fortune coming to him, for he does not doubt that what TJ obtained for him from Mde. Bellanger and the steps taken by Fenwick were powerful inducements to persuade his kinsman to favor him. His gratitude is beyond measure. [P.S.]Monticello, Sunday morning[14 Aug. 1791]. He has just seen Mr. Randolph, who leaves at once for Richmond. On his advice about the best way to obtain the legacy, he has written to Mr. Fenwick and to the executor the two letters enclosed which are left open for TJ to read, in order to draw the sum directly from Bordeaux if his uncle had not obtained it or, if he had, to inform him. He therefore asks TJ to write to his uncle at Nantes about the safest and most prompt means of procuring the legacy."

    "content": "Philadelphia Decr 27. 1779\nSir\nYour Excellencys Letter of the 17th Instant, inclosing the Judge Advocates of the 15th came to my hand but just before the post sat out again for Morris-Town, which put it out of my power to answer it till now.\nMr Laurance formed a right Judgment on the Contents of my former letters, they being only intended to shew that the Complaints against Dr Shippen were weighty in order to induce Congress to direct that he should be suspended from Office till the Event of his Trial could be known. My View therein was to put it out of his power to execute a Project which I found him engaged in, to try, if possible, to deprive me of the Means of appearing against him, by overawing & influencing Witnesses. But more particularly I hoped by his Suspension to take from him all excuse of not having time enough for his trial, whenever a Court Martial should be appointed, and for settling his books and Accompts; And Concluded that he could, in that Case, be the more easily induced to attend to the examination andtaking the Depositions of the Evidences that might be necessary to prove or disprove my Charges against him—Those Charges are contained in the inclosed Paper (No. 1.).\nAs they are chiefly founded on his transactions within the State of Pennsylvania, and as there is no law of this state to compell Witnesses to attend Courts-Martial in other states, I therefore on my return from the visit I made to Camp, applied to Congress in October last to pass such resolves, or to devise such Means, as in its wisdom should seem meet, to render good and reasonable evidence on facts firm & effectual, that I might be prepared for the Trial, whenever it should be appointed, and that if any delay of the Trial should take place, it might not be ascribed to any fault in me. In consequence of that Application, Congress did, on the 16th of November pass the following Vote, vizt.\n“Resolved, that it be recommended to the executive Authority of the different States, upon Application of the Judge Advocate for that purpose, to grant proper writs to require and compell the person or persons whose Attendance shall be required by the said Judge to appear and give testimony in any Cause depending before a Court-Martial, and that it be recommended to the Legislatures of the several States to vest the necessary powers for the purposes aforesaid, in the executive Authorities, if the same be not already done.”\nThe State of New Jerseys accordingly passed a Law for that purpose, a Copy of which I inclose for your Excellencys Satisfaction. But the Assembly of Pennsylvania, being then near the Close of its Session had not time to go through that bussiness, but adjourned to the 19th day of January next; proposing next Session to frame a law agreeable to the desire of Congress, expressed in the aforesaid Resolve; but that will be too late, in all probability, to be of any service in the trial of Doctr Shippen: Wherefore, on receipt of your Excellencys Letter, calling for a state of my charges against Dr Shippen, I again represented to Congress the necessity of establishing the mode of examining, and giving validity to the testimony of witnesses, so as to pass in evidence before Courts-Martial. Whereupon Congress, on the 24th Inst., by a unanimous Vote of the united states, came to the following Resolutions, vizt.\n“Resolved,That in trials of Cases not capital before Courts-Martial, the Deposition of Witnesses not in the line or Staff of the Army, may be taken before some Justice of the Peace and read in Evidence; provided the Prosecutor & Person accused, are present at the taking the same, or that Notice be given of the times and places of taking such Depositions to the opposite party four days previous thereto, when the Witness resides within the distance of 30 Miles from such party, and six days when the Witness resides above the distance of thirty, and not exceeding eighty Miles, and a reasonable Time for a greater Distance.”\n“ResolvedThat to encourage Witnesses who do not belong to the Army to attend on Courts-Martial, and give their Evidence viva voce, when required by the Judge Advocate, the reasonable Expences of such witnesses shall be defrayed by the united states, and paid by the Pay-Master to the Board of War & Ordnance, being first adjusted by the said Board.”\nIn Consequence of the above, I have given Notice to Dr Shippen to attend on Saturday next, the taking of Depositions at and near the Yellow Springs; on Monday following at Lancaster; on tuesday at Ephrata, and Adams Town; On Monday following at Nazareth; on Tuesday at Bethlehem, on Wednesday and Thursday at Bucks County. By Wednesday the 18th of January, or thereabout I shall be prepared to set out for Camp; but I mean to go by the Way of Reading and Bethlehem, in order to bring on with me the necessary Viva voce Evidences, whom I beg leave therefore to name to your Excellence, that orders may be given to the Judge Advocate to summons them to appear on the day to be fixt for the Trial, of which I hope to recieve Notice on return from my first Tour already mentioned.\nThe Names of those persons are MrMichael Bright,Capt.John Mears,MrJohn Fryof the town of Reading Baltzar GeerEsqr. of Berks County. This last named person was lately, and I know not but he still continues to act as a Deputy, in the Quarter Masters Department, under Col. Jacob Morgan of Reading; Nicholas Rimmelof Northampton County, and Wm Bennet of Buckingham Township, Bucks County, Tavern-keeper;Joseph Tatumof Wood-berry in the Jerseys, (to whom the Jersey law will extend,) being 9 Miles from Philadelphia; LikewiseDr Benjamin Rush,DrJames Hutchinson,and MrPeter Ozeasof Philadelphia.\nAll these are so necessary for the proving of fraud & misconduct that I cannot dispense with their personal Attendance if it is any ways possible to induce them to appear at the Trial. Most of them have, on my Application to them for that purpose declared that if they recieve a Summons from the Judge Advocate, they shall think it their Duty, and be willing to attend and give Evidence of what they know; but otherwise most of them would decline going, least they should be looked upon as Officious, or be objected to as forward Evidences, to the Idea of which they have an utter Aversion. If the Judge Advocate will be pleased to make out the necessary Citations, and inclose under Cover to me, so that I may recieve them by the time of my expected Return to Philadelphia on the 14th or 15th day of January, I will charge myself with their safe Conveyance to the respective Gentlemen.\nTo the above List of Evidences, whose personal appearance at the Trial I consider as essentially requisite, I add the following Names of the Gentlemen belonging to the Line and Staff of the Army, whose Attendance I take the Liberty to point out as also necessary, to convict Dr Shippen of Ignorance, or criminal Neglect of Duty; from which the Sick suffered amazingly, and dyed in great Numbers in Consequence thereof. viztMajr Burnet,of General Green’s family,Dr BrownPhysician General of the Hospital,Dr Tilton, Dr Binney, Dr Wm Smith ofLong Island, Gilbert Tennent, John Rogers andRobert Henry,Surgeons and Mates of the General Hospital;Jacob Hall,regimental Surgeon, now at Philada, I believe he belongs to Col. Scammel’s New Hampshire Battalion, andJames FinleySurgeon of Col: Biggelow’s; andMr John De la Mater,Clerk and Pay-Master of the General Hospital, in the Eastern Department. These Gentlemen being in the Service, Your Excellencys Order, or the Judge Advocates summons to attend the Trial will be necessary and affectual.\nHere I cannot refrain from expressing my particular wish that Dr Shippen might be informed officially by the Judge Advocate that I call forallhis Books, as Vouchers at the Trial to support or invalidate my third Charge. If his Books are not produced when I prove his selling hospital Stores, he may alledge he has given Credit for them, or may call them his own; or declare they are not posted. Should this Plea be allowed after an Order of Congress has passed near two Years ago, on taking the Purveyorshipout of Dr Shippens hands for the settlement of his Accompts, and his being repeatedly called upon by the Commissioners of Accompts for that purpose, he will have it in his power to cover part of one Crime by the Commission of another, and may make or give directions to make Post-Entries to elude the full detection of his Malpractices under this Charge.\nI take it for granted the Charges against Dr Shippen as stated in the inclosed Paper (No. 2) are sufficiently specific to answer the Intentions mentioned in your Excellencys Letter, being as I am well advised, as particular as is usual in like Cases. If I enter into a further specification of particulars, I must state the Substance of all the Evidences under each Charge, which would be immoderately lengthy, &, I imagine, unnecessarily minute. I only add that I expect to have my Materials so well arranged for the Trial, under each respective charge, as to save the Judge Advocate a great deal of Trouble in that part of the Bussiness; and by taking depositions before the Trial, I hope to shorten the Session of the Court Martial, & save Considerable Expences to the united States.\nIn expectation of your further Commands, I remain, with all Deference—Your Excellency’s Most Obedt Servant\nJohn Morgan"

Those Motives, and my Want of Information respecting Circumstances, will, I hope, procure Me your Forgiveness.\nIt is asserted here, that a British Officer taken at Yorktown, is to be executed in Retaliation for Mr Huddy, as General Carleton has not delivered up the person principally concerned in that horrid Murder.\nA Doubt has arisen in my Mind, whether this procedure will be thought regular. My Doubt turns on these points. 1st—How far Mr Huddy could be regarded as under your Excellency’s Command—2ly—How far his Execution may be considered as done by public Authority, or as a private Murder—3ly—How far a Refusal by a Commander in Chief to deliver up a Criminal guilty of an Offence unauthorized and disapproved by him and for which the Criminal is amenable to him will support a Retaliation—4ly—How far a Refusal by General Carleton to deliver up a Criminal for an Offence committed during the Command of General Clinton will support a Retaliation—5ly—How far Instances of Execution by Orders of celebrated Commanders will in Likeness of Circumstances support such a Retaliation—6ly—How far such a Retaliation may be proper, viewing the Capitulation of Yorktown in all its Light.\nI rely on your Excellency’s Judgment to determine, what Regard is due to these Reflections. If they deserve any, yet it is possible, some of them may have escaped your Attention, engaged as it constantly is in important Cases and Labors for the Welfare of your Country—For, how many Inclinations of your Heart are sacrificed to her Service. Permit the possibility I have mentioned, to plead in my Excuse.\nI have not intimated to any person that I should write on this affair, nor have exprest my Doubt in Conversation. I beg You, Sir, to be assured that I am with all possible Esteem, your Excellencys most obedt & hble servt\nJohn Dickinson"

I have enjoyed a greater share of health than falls to the lot of most men; my spirits have never failed me except under those paroxysms of grief which you, as well as myself, have experienced in every form: and with good health and good spirits the pleasures surely outweigh the pains of life. why not then taste them again, fat and lean together. were I indeed permitted to cut off from the train the last 7. years, the balance would be much in favor of treading the ground over again. being at that period in the neighborhood of our Warm springs, and well in health, I wished to be better, and tried them. they destroyed, in a great degree, my internal organism, and I have never since had a moment of perfect health. I have now been 8 months confined almost constantly to the house, with now and then intervals of a few days on which I could get on horseback.\nI presume you have recieved a copy of the life of RichdH Lee from his grandson of the same name, author of the work. you and I know that he merited much during the revolution. eloquent, bold and ever watchful at his post, of which his biographer omits no proof.

I know him personally and intimately. he is perfectly clear & independant in his circumstances, of as pure integrity as lives, and indefatigable in whatever he undertakes. he is at present a member of our legislature, & of great influence in it, which he has justly acquired by his merit & talents.

The Expressions of what I owe you cannot be as extensive as my gratitude.’Tis with the greatest sensibility, I experience every instant how useful and easy it is to act in concert with a great man, who joins to all his other talents that of the most punctual exactness.\nThe Gazette that you have had the goodness of sending me is an additional indication —The diversion has I believe operated; the movements you are making with your troops are nevertheless founded in reason. The principles of your Excellency give solidity to my own; persuaded with you, Sir, that Admiral Byron, although he set his head to the East is, at this time, very far from the Continent. If I determine to put to sea, which I have had it in my power to do for several days past—I will not get under sail, until it shall be demonstrated, that if the English Admiral is coming here, I shall meet him on the way; and that I shall contribute to the surety of the town of Boston, more effi caciously, than if I should remain moored where I am.\nGeneral DuPortail, with whom, I have had a long conversation has returned of himself to your opinion. It is perfectly mine—I am fully persuaded with him of the importance it is of to the common cause to raise fortifications at Boston and elsewhere. They will be excellent and very little expensive, if they are conducted on a general plan. If one be not established—it will be as it is, in all our fortified places in Europe, the greater part of which want system and a connexion of the whole; insomuch that the subsequent works have been constructed only to correct the defects of the first—The happiness and safety of America is your own work—it ought to be rendered eternal.\n’Tis Mr Holker agent and consul of France who will have the honor of repairing forthwith to Your Excellency—to communicate to you in my name objects which may be interesting, and of which I entreat you not to confide the secret but to Col.

    "content": "Quincy, Feb. 17, 1812.\n\nI was not long at the Adelphi, but soon removed to private lodgings, which by the way were ten times more public, and took apartments at Mr. Stokdale’s, in Piccadilly, where Mr. Laurens had lately lodged before me.Here I had a great opportunity of learning, for Dr. Bret was at the next door, the state of the current literature of London. I will not enlarge upon this subject at present, if ever. I found it exactly similar to what I had seen in Paris. The newspapers, the magazines, the reviews, the daily pamphlets, were all in the hands of hirelings, men of no character. I will sum up all upon this subject at present, in the words of one of the most active and extensive among the printers and booksellers to me, “Sir, said he, the men of learning in London, are all stark mad.” “There are in this city at least, one hundred men of the best education, the best classical studies, the most accomplished writers, any one of whom I can hire for one guinea a day, to go into my closet and write for me whatever I please, for or against any man or any cause. It is indifferent to them whether they write pro or con.”\nThese were the men both in Paris and London, who preached about the progress of reason, the improvements of society, the liberty, equality, fraternity, and the rights of man. They made their experiment in France; and came very near it in England, Holland, Germany, Switzerland, Geneva, and indeed in all the rest of Europe. It is no wonder, that so many of them concurred with Tacitus and Quintillian, in avowing their doubts whether the world was governed by blind chance or eternal fate. If they had not discarded a much better and more divine philosophy, they would never have reduced the world to this anarchy and chaos.\nCuriosity prompted me to trot about London as fast as good horses in a decent carriage could carry me. I was introduced by Mr. Hartley, on a merely ceremonious visit, to the Duke of Portland, Mr. Burke, and Mr. Fox; but finding nothing but ceremony there, I did not ask favours or receive any thing but cold formalities from ministers of state or ambassadors. I found that our American painters had more influence at court to procure all the favors I wanted, than all of them. Mr. West asked of their majesties permission to shew me and Mr. Jay, the originals of the great productions of his pencil, such as Wolf, Bayard, Epaminondas, Regulus, &c. &c. &c. which were all displayed in the Queen’s Palace, called Buckingham House. The gracious answer of the king and queen was, that he might shew us “the whole house.” Accordingly, in the absence of the royal family at Windsor, we had an opportunity at leisure, to see all the apartments, even to the queen’s bed-chamber, with all its furniture, even to her majesty’s German bible, which attracted my attention as much as any thing else. The king’s library struck me with admiration; I wished for a weeks time, but had but a few hours. The books were in perfect order, elegant in their editions, paper, binding, &c. but gaudy and extravant in nothing. They were chosen with perfect taste and judgment; every book that a king ought to have always at hand, and as far as I could examine, and could be supposed capable of judging, none other. Maps, charts, &c. of all his dominions in the four quarters of the world, and models of every fortress in his empire.\nIn every apartment of the whole house, the same taste, the same judgment, the same elegance, the same simplicity, without the smallest affectation, ostentation, profusion or meanness. I could not but compare it, in my own mind, with Versailles, and not at all to the advantage of the latter. I could not help comparing it with many of the gentlemen’s seats which I had seen in France, England, and even Holland. The interior of this palace was perfect; the exterior, both in extent, cost and appearance, was far inferior not only to Versailles, and the seats of the princes in France, but to the country houses of many of the nobility and gentry of Great Britain. The truth is, a minister can at any time obtain from parliament an hundred millions to support any war, just or unjust, in which he chooses to involve the nation, much more easily than he can procure one million for the decent accommodation of the court. We gazed at the great original paintings of our immortal countryman, West, with more delight than on the very celebrated pieces of Vandyke and Reubens; and with admiration not less than that inspired by the cartoons of Raphael.\nMr. Copely, another of my countrymen, with whom I had been much longer acquainted, and who had obtained without so much royal protection, a reputation not less glorious; and that by studies and labours not less masterly in his art, procured me, and that from the great Lord Mansfield, a place in the house of lords, to hear the king’s speech at the opening of parliament, and to witness the introduction of the Prince of Wales, then arrived at the age of twenty one. One circumstance, a striking example of the vicissitudes of life, and the whimsical antithesis of politics, is too precious for its moral, to be forgotten. Standing in the lobby of the house of lords, surrounded by a hundred of the first people of the kingdom, Sir Francis Mollaeux, the gentleman usher of the black rod, appeared suddenly in the room with his long staff, and roared out with a very loud voice—“Where is Mr. Adams, Lord Mansfield’s friend!” I frankly avowed myself Lord Mansfield’s friend, and was politely conducted by Sir Francis to my place. A gentleman said to me the next day, “how short a time has passed, since I heard that same Lord Mansfield say in that same house of lords, “My Lords, if you do not kill him, he will kill you.” Mr. West said to me, that this was one of the finest finishings in the picture of American Independence.”\nPope had given me, when a boy, an affection for Murray. When in the study and practice of the law, my admiration of the learning, talents and eloquence of Mansfield had been constantly increasing, though some of his opinions I could not approve. His politics in American affairs I had always detested.—But now I found more politeness and good humor in him than in Richmond, Cambden, Burke or Fox.\nIf my business had been travels I might write a book. But I must be as brief as possible.\nI visited Sir Ashton Lever’s museum, where was a wonderful collection of natural and artificial curiosities from all parts and quarters of the globe. Here I saw again that collection of American birds, insects and other rarities, which I had so often seen before at Norwalk, in Connecticut, collected and preserved by Mr. Arnold, and sold by him to Governor Tryon for Sir Ashton. Here also I saw Sir Ashton and some other knights, his friends, practising the ancient but as I thought long forgotten art of archery. In his garden, with their bows and arrows, they hit as small a mark and at as great a distance as any of our sharpshooters could have done with their rifles.\nI visited also Mr. Wedgwood’s manufactory, and was not less delighted with the elegance of his substitute for porcelain, than with his rich collection of utensils and furniture from the ruins of Herculaneum, bearing incontestible evidence in their forms and figures of the taste of the Greeks, a nation that seems to have existed for the purpose of teaching the arts and furnishing models to all mankind of grace and beauty, in the mechanic arts no less than in statuary, architecture, history, oratory and poetry.\nThe manufactory of cut glass, to which some gentlemen introduced me, did as much honor to the English as the mirrors, the seve China, or the gobeline tapestry of France. It seemed to be the art of transmitting glass into diamonds.\nWestminster Abbey, St. Pauls, the Exchange and other public buildings, did not escape my attention. I made an excursion to Richmond Hill to visit Gov. Pownal and Mr. Penn, but had not time to visit Twickenham. The grotto and the quin cunce, the rendezvous of Swift, Bolinbroke, Arbuthnot, Gay, Prior, and even the surly Johnson and the haughty Warburton, will never be seen by me, though I ardently desired it.\nI went to Windsor and saw the castle and its apartments, and enjoyed its vast prospect. I was anxiously shewn the boasted chambers where Count Tallard, the captive of the Duke of Marlborough, had been confined. I visited the terrace and the environs, and what is of more importance I visited the Eaton school; and if I had been prudent enough to negotiate with my friend West, I doubt not I might have obtained permission to see the queen’s lodge. But as the solicitation of these little favors requires a great deal of delicacy and many prudent precautions, I did not think it proper to ask the favor of any body. I must confess that all the pomps and pride of Windsor did not occupy my thoughst so much as the forest, and comparing it with what I remembered of Pope’s Windsor forest.\nMy health was very little improved by the exercise I had taken in and about London; nor did the entertainments and delights assist me much more. The change of air and of diet from which I had entertained some hopes, had produced little effect. I continued feeble, low and drooping. The waters of Bath were still represented to me as an almost certain resource. I shall take no notice of men nor things on the road. I had not been twenty minutes at the hotel du Bath before my ancient friend and relation, Mr. John Boylston called upon me and dined with me. After dinner he was polite enough to walk with me, about the town, shewed me the crescent, the public buildings, the cards rooms, the assembly rooms, the dancing rooms, &c. objects about which I had little more curiosity than about the bricks and pavements. The baths and the accommodations for using the waters were reserved for another day. But before that day arrived, I received dispatches from America, from London, and from Amsterdam, informing me that the drafts of congress by Mr. Morris, for money to be transmitted, in silver, through the house of Le Couteux, at Paris, and through the Havana to Philadelphia; together with the bills drawn in favor of individuals in France, England and Holland, had exhausted all my loan of the last summer which had cost me so much fatigue and ill health; and that an immense flock of new bills had arrived, drawn in favour of Sir George Baring, or Sir Francis Baring, I forget which, of London, and many other persons; that these bills had been already presented, and protested for non-acceptance; and that they must be protested in their time for non-payment, unless I returned immediately to Amsterdam, and could be fortunate enough to obtain a new loan, of which my bankers gave me very faint hopes. It was winter; my health was very delicate, a journey and voyage to Holland at that season would very probably put an end to my labours. I scarcely saw a possibility of surviving it. Nevertheless no man knows what he can bear till he tries. A few moments reflection determined me, for although I had little hope of getting the money, having experienced so many difficulties before, yet making the attempt and doing all in my power would discharge my own conscience, and ought to satisfy my responsibility to the public. I returned to London, and from thence repaired to Harwich. Here we found the packet detained by contrary winds and a violent storm. For three days detained, in a very uncomfortable inn, ill accommodated and worse provided, myself and my son, without society and without books, were away three days of ennui, not a little chagrined with the unexpected interruption of our visit to England, and the disappointment of our journey to Bath; and not less anxious on account of our gloomy prospects for the future.\nOn the fourth day the wind having veered a little, we were summoned on board the packet. With great difficulty she turned the point and gained the open sea. In this channel, on both sides the island of Great-Britain, there is in bad weather a tremulous, undulating, turbulent kind of irregular tumbling sea that disposes men more to the male de mer than even the surges of the gulph stream, which are more majestic. The passengers were all at extremities for almost the whole of the three days that we were struggling with stormy weather and beating against contrary winds. The captain and his men, worn out with fatigue and want of sleep, despaired of reaching Helvoet Sluice, and determined to land us on the island of Goree. We found ourselves, upon landing, on a desolate shore, we knew not where. A fisherman’s hut was all the building we could see. There we were told it was five or six miles from the town of Goree. The man was not certain of the distance; but it was not less than four miles nor more than six. No kind of conveyance could be had. In my weak state of health, rendered more impotent by bad nourishment, want of sleep, and wasting sickness on board the packet, I thought it almost impossible, that in that severe weather, I could walk through ice and snow, four miles before I could find rest. As has been said before, human nature never knows what it can endure before it tries the experiment. My young companion was in fine spirits; his gaiety, activity, and attention to me encreased as difficulties multiplied, and I was determined not to despair. I walked on, with caution and moderation, and survived much better than could have been expected, till we reached the town of Goree. When we had rested and refreshed ourselves at the inn, we made enquiries concerning our future rout. It was pointed out to us, and we found we must cross over the whole island of Goree, then cross the arm of the sea to the island of Over Flackee, and run the whole length of that island to the point from whence the boats pass a very wide arm of the sea to the continent, five or six miles from Helvoet Sluice. But we were told that the rivers and arms of the sea were all frozen over, so that we could not pass them but upon the ice, or in ice boats. Inquiring for a carriage of some kind or other, we were told that the place afforded none better, and indeed none other than boer’s waggons. That this word boer may not give offence to any one, it is necessary to say, that it signifies no more in Dutch, than peasant in France, or countryman, husbandman or farmer in America. Finding no other vehicle, we ordered a waggon, horses & driver to be engaged for us, and departed on our journey. Our carriage had no springs to support, nor cushions to soften the seats. On hard benches, in a waggon fixed to the axle-tree, we were trotted and jolted over the roughest road you can well imagine. The soil upon these islands is a stiff clay, and in rainy weather becomes as soft and miry as mortar. In this state they have been trodden by horses, and cut into deep rutts by waggon wheels, when a sudden change of the weather had frozen them hard as rocks. Over this bowling green, we rolled, or rather hopped and skipped, twelve miles in the island of Goree, and I know not how many more in Over-flackee, till we arrived at the inn at the ferry, where we again put up. Here we were obliged to wait several days, because the boats were all on the other side. The pains of waiting for a passage were much alleviated here by the inexpressible delight of rest after such violent agitations by sea and land, by good fires, warm rooms, comfortable beds, and wholesome Dutch cheer. And all these were made more agreeable by the society of a young English gentleman, not more than twenty, who happening to come to the inn, and finding we had the best room and the best fire, came in, and very modestly and respectfully requested to sit with us. We readily consented and soon found ourselves very happy in his company. He was cheerful, gay, witty, perfectly well bred, and the best acquainted with English literature of any youth of his age I ever knew. The English classics, English history, and all the English poets were familiar to him. He breakfasted, dined, supped, and in short live with us, and we could not be dull, and never wanted conversation while we staid. As I never asked his name, or his history, I cannot mention either.\nWe were obliged to bid high for a passage, and promise them whatever they demanded. Signals were made and at last an ice-boat appeared. An ice-boat is a large ferry boat placed and fastened on runners. We embarked early in the morning. The passage is very wide over this arm of the sea. We were rowed in the water till we came to the ice, when the skipper and his men, to the number of eight or ten perhaps, leaped out upon the ice and hauled the boat up after them, when the passengers were required to get out of the boat and walk upon the ice, while the boatmen dragged the boat upon her runners. Presently they would come to a spot where the ice was thin and brittle, when all would give way and down went the boat into the water. The men were so habituated to this service that they very dexterously laid hold of the sides and leaped into the boat—then they broke away the thin ice till the boat came to a part thick enough for the passengers to leap in, when the men broke away the thin ice forward and rowed the boat in the water till she came to a place again strong enough to bear, when all must disembark again and march men and boat upon the ice. How many times we were obliged to embark and disembark in the course of the voyage I know not, but we were all day and till quite night in making the passage. The weather was cold—we were all frequently wet—I was chilled to the heart, and looked I suppose, as I felt, like a withered old worn out carcase. Our polite skipper frequently eyed me and said he pitied the old man. When we got ashore he said he must come and take the old man by the hand and wish him a safe journey to the Hague. He was sorry to see that I was in such bad health and suffered so much as he had observed upon the passage. He had done every thing in his power and so had his men, to make it easy and expeditious; but they could do no better. This I knew to be true. We parted very good friends, well satisfied with each other. I had given them what they very well loved and they had done their best for me.\nI am weary of my journey and shall hasten to its close. No carriage was to be had and no person to be seen; but by accident a beor came along with an empty waggon. We offered him any thing he would ask to take us to the Briel. Arrived there we obtained a more convenient carriage; but the weather was so severe and the roads so rough that we had a very uncomfortable journey to the Hague. Here I was at home in the Hotel Des Etats Unis, but could not indulge myself. My duty lay at Amsterdam among undertakers and brokers, with very faint hopes of success. I was however successful beyond my most sanguine expectations, and obtained a loan of millions enough to prevent all the bills of congress from being protested for non-payment and to preserve our credit in Europe for two or three years longer, after which another desperate draft of bills from congress obliged meonce more to go overfrom England to Holland to borrow money. I succeeded also in that which preserved our credit till my return to America, in 1788, and till the new government came into operation and found itself rich enough.\nIn the course of my correspondence with you I might have related many anecdotes and made many sketches of characters and drawn many portraits at full length, but I have avoided such things as much as I could. I was never a traveller, nor a book-maker, by profession, and shall never be likely to make profit by making a book.\nHere ends the very rough and uncouth detail of my voyages, journies, labors, perils and sufferings under my commissions for making peace with Great-Britain.\nI had ridden on horseback often to congress, over roads and across ferries of which the present generation have no idea, and once in 1777 in the dead of winter from Braintree to Baltimore five hundred miles upon a trotting horse, as Dean Swift boasted that he had done, or could do. I had been three days in the gulph stream, in 1778, in a furious hurricane and a storm of thunder and lightning, which struck down our men upon deck and cracked our mainmast; when the oldest officers and stoutest seamen stood aghast, at their last prayers, dreading every moment that a butt would start and all perish. I had crossed the Atlantic in 1779, in a leaky ship with perhaps 400 men on board, who were scarcely able with two large pumps going all the twenty-four hours to keep the water from filling the hold, in hourly danger for twenty days together of foundering at sea. I had passed the mountains in Spain in the winter, among ice and snow, partly on mule-back and partly on foot—Yet I never suffered so much in any of these situations as in that jaunt from Bath to Amsterdam, in January, 1788. Nor did any of those adventures ever do such lasting injuries to my health. I never got over it till my return home in 1788. The trepidation of this hand, in writing this sentence, has as I believe, been caused by it more than by any other error, irregularity, tryal or exertion of my whole life.\n(As it is not my intention, Messrs. Printers, that my correspondence with you shall be eternal, I have hastened over every thing but documents; and shall continue to be in future, as brief as possible.)\nJohn Adams."

Inclosed is the printers Account for them and receipt for the Price which may be reimbursed by an order, on the Collector at Baltimore.\n[I know of but one judicial decision that hath taken place in this State which was influenced by the treaty of peace, or to whichthat applied, and in that Case the Judgment of the Court was in favour of the British Creditor. By a Law passed in this State in October session 1780, Chapter 5 Sect. 11, the debtors of british creditors under certain Circumstances were authorized to pay their debts into the State treasury, and such Payments were declared to be Payments of their Creditors. Very large Sums were paid into the treasury under that Law, and at the last General Court in Annapolis October Term 1790, in a Suit by Mr. Mildred against Mr. Edward Dorsey who in every particular had complied with that Law, and paid a considerable Sum into the Treasury in discharge of his Debt, the Court gave judgment in favour of the Creditor, for his debt and interest, except that Part of the interest that accrued during the War, for which period they decided that no Interest was recoverable. This determination was in the Case of a debt due by Bond executed before the War,] and took place so short a time before I left Annapolis that I had not an Opportunity of obtaining an official transcript of the Case.—I know of no Laws or Acts of Government that have passed in this State which may certainly be considered as infractions of the treaty of peace. By a law passed at October Session 1780 Chap 45 all property in this State (debts only excepted) belonging to British subjects, was seised and confiscated to the use of this State. Some of this property remained unsold at the time of the treaty and several Laws have since passed for discovering british property, and directing Sales thereof, and under those Laws Some Sales have been made. To the confiscation Law and those passed since the treaty on the subject I refer you, the Latter are I believe the only Laws of this State that have in any manner been objected to as inconsistent with the Treaty, and will be found in November Session 1785.

And I must add that they have countenanced measures, in some of our Seaport towns, and in the Legislature that have appeared to me intemperate and unwise. Dr Benjamin Waterhouse has never united with them and this conduct has brought upon him resentments and oppositions which have ended in his deprivation of his employment which he has held for thirty years with reputation Of his literary character, which has been long known and established in Europe, and America, it would be idle in me to speak. I have known him more than thirty years and have never seen a stain upon his moral character I scarcely know a more benevolent or exemplary character. Though I am not minutely acquainted with the circumstances which has occasioned his removal from an office under the U.S. I have reason to beleive that his error proceeded from his ardent zeal to place the hospital in the best possible order: without any intention of deviating from the strict line of integrity. It is perhaps improper to mention anything in particular. If it is I beg your pardon for suggesting that if Congress should establish an office of Surgeon general and another of physician general and I know it to be the opinion of the best judges that both ought to be established; perhaps Waterhouse might fill that of Physician General to advantage. I mean not however to recommend him, for any particular employment: but if there should be any opening adequate to his age experience and character in my opinion, his professional, moral, literary and political Character is such as to give a fair claim for his being a Candidate. With great respect I have the honour to be Sir your most Obedient Servant\nJohn Adams"

But these resolutions, important as they were in rejecting the idea of separate peace negotiations on the part of the individualstates; in declaring the intent of Virginia to prosecute “the war with vigour and effect, until peace shall be obtained in a manner consistent with our national faith and fœderal union”; and in binding the Virginia delegates by instructions to this effect, with probable influence over the resolution of Congress of 4 Oct. 1782 [JCCdescription beginsWorthington C.

You know his anxiety to secure the appointment given him in the London university; to which is to be added the necessity he states of his returning to England on other accounts, at the expiration of his stipulated term; so that there is no chance of his permanent stay with us.\nI have just recd. a letter from Mr. Brougham Chairman of the Council tothe London University, saying that Mr. Long’s presence will be called for within the Autumn of this year, and that the council are very anxious that he may be released from his engagements here in time to be then there. My answer which it was proper to hasten, urges the greater difficulty here of providing a temporary substitute for him, than where adequate Teachers are so much more numerous; and hopes this consideration will be allowed its due weight by the Council; admitting at the same time our desire that Mr. Long may not be ultimately disappointed of the place he has so much at heart. This I conceived to be the vie⟨w of the⟩ case prevailing with the Visitors; Mr. L. appearing to have acted on the occasion with fa⟨irness & consis⟩tency, and with a desire to mitigate as much as he could, the inconveniency to the University ⟨from his leaving⟩ it. A compulsive detention of him with the loss of an object which he represents as of v⟨ital importance⟩ to the welfare of himself and his connections in England, would indeed impair not a little ⟨the advan⟩tage expected from his compleating the term of his contract with our University. I do not altogether despair that the London Council may withdraw their application, tho’ it is quite probable that the letter of Mr. B. has its origin in the suggestion of Mr. Long’s friends, if not of himself. It is possible also that delays may occur in opening the University which may remove the difficulty. That relating to the vacancy in the Chair left by Mr. Bonnycastle is still unremoved, awaiting a close of the correspondence on the subject in the hands of Genl. Cocke & Mr. Johnson.

If some blinds were thrown up within the Area of the Fort they wou’d be a security against Shells of which I think you are in more danger than from Shot. you seem apprehensive if the Enemy possess province Island, that your Men must quit their Barracks in that case you should think of finding out some more secure place of Sheltering them. I cannot at present think of any place better than between the East face of the stone Fort and the lower Battery, they will at leastbe safe there untill an attack begins from the water. I desir’d Capt. Blewer who went from hence yesterday, to caution the Commodore against an unnecessary expenditure of ammunition and beg that you woud also be careful in that point, for should the Enemy cut off your intercourse with us, you will find the want of it. I am Sir your most Obet Servt\nG. W——n\nP.S. Should the Enemy get Possession of the Ground near the Pest Houses what effect wou’d their fire have upon Shipping? If this ground would be advantageous to us do you think part of your Garrison, part of that intended for Red Bank, and some Militia from Jersey could possess & defend it? It is my wish that Colo. Green & you in concert with the Gentn of the Navy, would turn your attention to every place which will contribute to the defence of the Water obstructions, & if it is in my Power to afford assistance, I will do it."

    "content": "London, Sept. 16. 1758\nDear Friend,\nYour kind Letter of June 1. gave me great Pleasure. I thank you for the Concern you express about my Health, which at present seems tolerably confirm’d by my late Journeys into different Parts of the Kingdom, that have been highly entertaining as well as useful to me. Your Visits to my little Family in my Absence are very obliging, and I hope you will be so good as to continue them. Your Remark on the Thistle and the Scotch Motto, made us very merry, as well as your String of Puns. You will allow me to claim a little Merit or Demerit in the last, as having had some hand in making you a Punster; but the Wit of the first is keen, and all your own.\nTwo of the former Members of the Junto you tell me are departed this Life, Potts and Parsons. Odd Characters, both of them. Parsons, a wise Man, that often acted foolishly. Potts, a Wit, that seldom acted wisely. IfEnoughwere the Means to make a Man happy, One had always theMeansof Happiness without ever enjoying theThing;the other had always theThingwithout ever possessing the Means. Parsons, even in his Prosperity, always fretting! Potts, in the midst of his Poverty, ever laughing! It seems, then, that Happiness in this Life rather depends on Internals than Externals; and that, besides the natural Effects of Wisdom andVirtue, Vice and Folly, there is such a Thing as being of a happy or an unhappy Constitution. They were both our Friends, and lov’d us. So, Peace to their Shades. They had their Virtues as well as their Foibles; they were both honest Men, and that alone, as the World goes, is one of the greatest of Characters. They were old Acquaintance, in whose Company I formerly enjoy’d a great deal of Pleasure, and I cannot think of losing them, without Concern and Regret.\nLet me know in your next, to what Purposes Parsons will’d his Estate from his Family; you hint at something which you have not explain’d.\nI shall, as you suppose, look on every Opportunity you give me of doing you Service, as a Favour, because it will afford me Pleasure. Therefore send your Orders for buying Books as soon as you please. I know how to make you ample Returns for such Favours, by giving you the Pleasure of Building me a House. You may do it without losing any of your own Time; it will only take some Part of that you now spend in other Folks Business. ’Tis only jumping out of their Waters into mine.\nI am grieved for our Friend Syng’s Loss. You and I, who esteem him, and have valuable Sons ourselves, can sympathise with him sincerely. I hope yours is perfectly recovered, for your sake as well as for his own. I wish he may be in every Respect as good and as useful a Man as his Father. I need not wish him more; and can now only add that I am, with great Esteem, Dear Friend, Yours affectionately\nBFranklin\nMr. Roberts\nP.S.I rejoice to hear of the Prosperity of the Hospital, and send the Wafers.\nI do not quite like your absenting yourself from that good old Club the Junto: Your more frequentPresencemight be a meansof keeping them from beingAll Engag’d in Measures not the best for the Publick Welfare. I exhort you therefore to return to your Duty; and, as the Indians say, to confirm my Words, I send you a Birmingham Tile.\nI thought the neatness of the Figures would please you.\nPray send me a good Impression of the Hospital Seal in Wax. 2 or three would not be amiss, I may make a good Use of them."

You will observe that I have dropt the Freeman’s Journal, and substituted the Evening Herald in its place. The former grew intolerably stupid and uninteresting. The latter gives the Debates in our Assembly, which I doubt not will afford you amusement and knowledge of our affairs.\nThe Arrival of Dr. Franklin has given a Spur to our philosophical Society. Several curious Communications of his have been read at our Meetings. We have a second volume of Transactions in the Press. It will be compleated by the Spring. I shall not fail to send you a Copy as soon as possible after the Publication. A Mr. Magellan of London has offered us 200 Guineas, to be vested in some permanent Fund, so as to yield 10 GS. pr. annum to be awarded by the Society as an Annual Premium in a plate of Gold of 10 GS. value, with certain Inscriptions, to the Author of the best Discovery or most useful Improvement relating toNavigationorNatural Philosophy.\nWhen the Scheme shall be ripe and the Door open I intend to be a Candidate. I have contrived a Method of assisting a vessel in her sailing which promises great Success. It is simple, trifling in Point of Expence, and demonstrable in Theory. The Experiment has not yet been tried, but will be before long. Those to whom I have shewn it encourage me greatly, and seem satisfied that it must answer. I wrote you some Time ago an Account of my Discovery of a new Method of drawing the Tone from a Harpsichord. I believe I sent you a Model. I am much pleased with this Invention. It answers to admiration. I have instructed an ingenious workmanhere, and he is engaged in altering the Harpsichords of this City according to my Plan. If you should ever have the Opportunity of hearing a Harpsichord so furnished you will be surprised at the Effect. All the Jingle, so much complained of in that Instrument, is removed. The Tone is full, round, and mellow, and, in the Bass, very like the Diaposon Stop of an Organ. I am confident that the Power of the Instrument was never before drawn forth. Crow Quils will hereafter be totally thrown aside. I sent this Discovery to a friend in England. He was to offer it for 50 Guineas but writes in answer that my Invention had been anticipated. I see I am to be defrauded both of the Money and Credit, but I will have the Matter investigated.\nI wrote to you some Time ago for two or three Sets of Crayons. I wish you would add also a dozen or two of Camel hair Pencils sorted, and a Dozen of good black lead Pencils. The whole Expence will be trifling, and I will fully account in any manner you shall direct. I am much pleased with theBibliothèque Œconomiqueyou sent me. I hope you will continue to supply me with them. I have lent your Notes on Virginia to some friends, under the Restrictions you prescribed. They have been instructed and improved by them, and speak highly in Commendation.\nIt is long, very long, since I have heard from you, but expect every week. I wish it was in my Power to render you any Service or express how much I value your Friendship. Excuse me. I hate any thing that looks like Compliment. But command me to the uttermost.\nMy good Mother is with me and desires to be kindly remembered to you and Miss Patty.\nMr. Rittenhouse is making a very curious and interesting Experiment, of which I will give you an Account in due Time.\nI detain you too long with my Chat. Adieu and believe me to be sincerely Your’s,\nF:Hopkinson"

The distress of the Army for want of forrage had Come to the last Extremity, indeed the very existance of it depended on an immediate relief, and however disagreable the Measure, Necessity has Obliged me to grant a Warrant to impress forrage from farmers round us, for a temporary releif untill some Can be brought in from a greater distance. I have wrote fully on this Subject to General Greene, who is fully Sensible of the Measure, but unless other Measure’s are taken to get in Indian Corn from those Counties remarkable for growing it the distress will soon be greater than ever, and without remedy, we shall have no such rescource to go to.

Basset; but owing to the press of business and the length of the Session, I must at its conclusion, immediately return to my family in the new State of Maine, which is about organizing its Government, and putting at the head of it, GenlKing, who visited you last winter, and with which visit, he was exceedingly delighted.\nBy my exertions with one of my Collegues MrHolmesin putting at rest the Missouri question & the consequent admission of Maine, we have brought down upon ourselves the vengence of the remnant of a party, to which you allude in your letter to MrLangdon, but they will not I hope be able to destroy us.\nOf your welfare I often hear at the Presidents, and am glad to find your health is restored.\nThat your declining years may be as tranquil & happy, as the services you have rendered to your Country have been great & illustrious, is the ardent wish of\nMark Langdon Hill."

Inst with all its enclosures respecting the protest of the Treasury Drafts on Norfolk & this day they have been laid before the Directors. I thank you for the trouble you have taken in your free and full explanation of this disagreeable transaction. The mistake made in the Office considering the early State of the business, was a natural One, & I think with you that Mr Lindsey should have paid the drafts & coverd himself under the directions, tothe Collector of Norfolkespecially with the additional circumstance, that he could not doubt the Signatures of either The Treasurer or Cashier. Its plain that he had the Money and therefore the conclusion must be, either that he was overcautious, being young in his Office, or else, that he meant it as a reproof to the Treasury for their mistake. However, I think you have Stated the whole transaction to him in such Strong & pointed terms, that his feelings must be roused and he will be more Cautious in future. Your resolution of calling on him for an explanation before any formal complaint was made to the president, was certainly proper, and I hope he may give you such satisfaction as to render Such complaintquite unnecessary. I now Send you Mr Hunters Letter of the 1st. of October with both the Original returns from Norfolk &Portsmouth& thank you for the having so confidentially troubled them for our Inspection. The duplicate letter for Mr Lindsey has been Sent forward with Some of the drafts which have been Sold to Mr Taylor—but here too, perhaps Mr Lindsey may plead a misdirection, for you have not in these latter drafts, given the full description of him as Collector, which he takes when he Signs his Official returns, to which he adds—Collectors OfficeNorfolk & Portsmouth. The Treasurer has only directed his drafts to him as Collector of Norfolk you’l excuse me for mentioning this very trifeling Circumstance, it argues a Suspecion perhaps, which nothing could warrant, except Mr Lindsays past conduct—which certainly marks him as a man of nice puntillio.\nI am Sir Most respectfully Yr Obdt Servt."

Adjutant General has not, as yet been able to procure a Return of the Troops, but expects that he will be able to deliver it to me by to Morrow—Part of the Enemy’s Force is at Skenesborough—A Body of between one & two thousand at Castleton and another returned to Tyonderoga in order to come by that Rout across Lake George—They have an advanced post at a Block House near Fort Ann and their Indian Scouts are continually lurking about our advanced posts—The Day before Yesterday they made prisoners of two Waggoners near Fort George.\nWe have brought away every Thing we had at Fort George and Yesterday Colonel Van Dyke, agreeable to his Orders, quitted the post, after seeing every part of it in Flames—Strengthened with that Garrison, who are in good Health, and if the Militia who are here or an equal Number can be prevailed on to stay and the Enemy give me a few Days more, which I think they will be obliged to do, I shall not be apprehensive that they will be able to force the posts, I am about to occupy.\nSo much of Toryism prevails amongst the people in what are commonly called the New Hampshire Grants and amongst those that reside in the Townships bordering on them, that I should not be much surprized if General Burgoyne should attempt to march as far as Bennington, in order to procure Cattle & Carriages, for I cannot, as yet, learn that many have been brought away, altho’ I gave the necessary Orders immediately on being informed of the Retreat from Tyonderoga—I have had part of Wood Creek filled with Trees and the Roads between this and Fort Ann broken up & rendered impassable, unless much Labour is bestowed on them.\nThe Cattle beyond this are all brought and bringing away, and I shall not leave any Forage for the Enemy’s Cattle to subsist upon.\nInclose your Excellency, Copy of a publication of General Burgoyne’s, with Copy of one of mine —I have ordered every person that has or may take a protection from the Enemy, and that can be taken, to be secured and sent to Goal.\nPart of the Militia from the Massachusetts and all those from New Hampshire I have ordered to join Colonel Warner, who is at Manchester and who has my Orders to advance as near the Enemy as he can, with the small Force he has, the better to bring off the Cattle & Carriages near them.

Wilkinson of Oct. 21. requested for the defence of Colo.

Burr to the officers at Orleans, Natchez Etc by the Secretaries of the War & Navy departments’, it seems to cover a correspondence of many months with such a variety of officers civil & military all over the US. as would amount to the laying open the whole executive books. I have desired the Secretary at War to examine his official communications, and on a view of these we may be able to judge what can & ought to be done towards a compliance with the request. if the defendant alleges that there was any particular order which as a cause, produced any particular act on his part, then he must know what this order was, can specify it, and a prompt answer can be given. if theobjecthad been specified we might then have had some guide for our conjectures as to what part of the Executive records might be useful to him. but, with a perfect willingness to do what is right, we are without the indications which may enable us to do it. if the researches of the Secretary at War should produce any thing proper for communication & pertinent to any point we can concieve in the defence before the court, it shall be forwarded to you.

Instead of testimonials in favor of doctr. Jones, I received from doctr. Horner, very strong recommendations of doctor Robert M.

Hobbs and Mandeville have found a perfect antidote to their poison in Bishop Buttler, Dr. Clarke, Dr. Tillotson, and twenty other writers, Voltair, Rousseau Didero, Dalembert, Frederick King of Prussia, and the Baron De Grimm, have found a compleat confutation in the contemplation of the Heavens and the Earth. The primitive world of Court de Gebellin, Bryants Mythology, and Dupuis Universal religion, and Volneys new researches into the History of Ancient Nations; Have not converted me to their system of Philosophy; Sir William Jones’s works have excited a curiosity for Oriental literature which can never be gratified.—I wish our Missionarys would import and translate Sanscrit, and Persian Books, we might possibly learn something useful from them that we do not know which might somewhat abate our Bigotry. But why am I running away in this random strain of pedantry—\nI lived for some years in the Basse Cour de Monsieure La Ray de Chaumont, that is in the Ancient Hotel de Valentinois, a Spacious Palace at Passy, yet Mr. de Chaumont was not above Manufactures in Cotton, or in Stone, I hope his Son, and Grand Son will succeed in their Iron Manufactors, and all their other interests—\nI would not advise you to indulge so wild a passion for reading as I have done, for it has neither done me good, or harm accept as a medicien for Ennui to your affectionate / Grand Father\nJohn Adams"

It is still a great satisfaction to me because I think it a Measure essentially right, both as it is a greater demonstration of Respect to the Powers, whose Ministers may assemble to make Peace, and as it is better calculated to give satisfaction to the People of America, as the Commissioners are chosen from the most considerable Places in that Country.\nIt is probable, that the French Court is already informed of the Alteration. Nevertheless I should think it proper that it should be officially notified to M. the Comte de Vergennes, and if You are of the same Opinion, as You are near I should be obliged to You if You would communicate to his Excellency an authentic Copy of the new Commission.\nI should think too that it would be proper to give some Intimation of it to the Public in the Gazette or Mercure de France, the two Papers which are published with the Consent of the Court, and if You are of the same Opinion, upon consulting the Comte de Vergennes, I should be glad to see it done.\nHave You any Information concerning Mr: Jefferson, whether he has accepted the Trust? whether he has embarked? or proposes soon to embark. I saw a paragraph in a Maryland Paper, which expressed an apprehension that he was taken Prisoner by a Party of Horse in Virginia.\nI feel a strong Curiosity to know the Answer of the British Court to the Articles to serve as a Basis &c—should be much obliged to your Excellency for a Copy of it, if to be procured, and for your Opinion, whether there will be a Congress or not.\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest Respect, Sir, your most obedient and most humble Servant\nJohn Adams"

    "content": "New York Feby. 19. 1788\nDear Sir\nBy the Count de Moustier I received your favour of the 8th. of October. I received by his hands also the watch which you have been so good as to provide for me, and for which I beg you to accept my particular thanks. During the short trial I have made she goes with great exactness. Since the arrival of the Count deMoustier, I have received also by the Packet Mr. Calonne’s publication for myself, and a number of the Mercure’s for Mr. Banister. The Bearer was a Mr. Stuart. I had a conveyance to Mr. Banister a few days after the Mercure’s came to hand.\nThe public here continues to be much agitated by the proposed fœderal Constitution and to be attentive to little else. At the date of my last Delaware Pennsylvania and New Jersey had adopted it. It has been since adopted by Connecticut, Georgia, and Massachusetts. In the first the minority consisted of 40 against 127. In Georgia the adoption was unanimous. In Massachusetts the conflict was tedious and the event extremely doubtful. On the final question the vote stood 187 against 168; a majority of 19 only being in favor of the Constitution. The prevailing party comprized however all the men of abilities, of property, and of influence. In the opposite multitude there was not a single character capable of uniting their wills or directing their measures. It was made up partly of deputies from the province of Maine who apprehended difficulties from the New Government to their scheme of separation, partly of men who had espoused the disaffection of Shay’s; and partly of ignorant and jealous men, who had been taught or had fancied that the Convention at Philada. had entered into a conspiracy against the liberties of the people at large, in order to erect an aristocracy for the rich thewell-born, and the men of Education. They had no plan whatever. They looked no farther than to put a negative on the Constitution and return home. The amendments as recommended by the Convention were as I am well informed not so much calculated for the minority in the Convention, on whom they had little effect, as for the people of the State. You will find the amendments in the Newspapers which are sent from the office of foreign affairs. It appears from a variety of circumstances that disappointment had produced no asperity in the minority, and that they will probably not only acquiesce in the event, but endeavour to reconcile their constituents to it. This was the public declaration of several who were called the leaders of the party. The minority of Connecticut behaved with equal moderation. That of Pennsylvania has been extremely intemperate and continues to use a very bold and menacing language. Had the decision in Massachusetts been adverse to the Constitution, it is not improbable that some very violent measures would have followed in that State. The cause of the inflamation however is much more in their State factions, than in the system proposed by theConvention. New Hampshire is now deliberating on the Constitution. It is generally understood that an adoption is a matter of certainty. South Carolina and Maryland have fixed on April or May for their Conventions. The former it is currently said will be one of the ratifying States. Mr. Chace and a few others will raise a considerable opposition in the latter. But the weight of personal influence is on the side of the Constitution, and the present expectation is that the opposition will be outnumbered by a great majority. This State is much divided in its sentiment. Its Convention is to be held in June. The decision of Massts. will give the turn in favor of the Constitution unless an idea should prevail or the fact should appear, that the voice of the State is opposed to the result of its Convention. North Carolina has put off her Convention till July. The State is much divided it is said. The temper of Virginia, as far as I can learn, has undergone but little change of late. At first there was an enthusiasm for the Constitution. The tide next took a sudden and strong turn in the opposite direction. The influence and exertions of Mr. Henry, and Col. Mason and some others will account for this. Subsequent information again represented the Constitution as regaining in some degree its lost ground. The people at large have been uniformly said to be more friendly to the Constitution than the Assembly. But it is probable that the dispersion of the latter will have a considerable influence on the opinions of the former. The previous adoption of nine States must have a very persuasive effect on the minds of the opposition, though I am told that a very bold language is held by Mr. H——y and some of his partisans. Great stress is laid on the self-sufficiency of that State, and the prospect of external props are alluded to.\nCongress have done no business of consequence yet, nor is it probable that much more of any sort will precede the event of the great question before the public.\nThe Assembly of Virginia have passed thedistrict Billof which I formerly gave you an account. There are 18 districts, with 4 new Judges, Mr. Gabl. Jones, Richd. Parker, St. George Tucker and Jos. Prentis. They have reduced much the taxes, and provided some indulgences for debtors. The question of British debts underwent great vicicitudes. It was after long discussion resolved by a majority of 30 against the utmost exertions of Mr. Henry that they should be paid as soon as the other States should have complied with the treaty. A few days afterwards he carriedhis point by a majority of 50 that G. B. should first comply. Adieu Yrs. Affecty.,\nJs. MadisonJr.\nP.S. Mr. St. John has given me a very interesting description of a System of Nature lately published at Paris. Will you add it for me. The Boxes which were to have come for myself G.W. and A. D. &c have not yet arrived."

Those who are best informed think the adverse party will be outnumbered at the start. It seems pretty clear now that in point of characters the advantage will be on the federal side. The three chancellors are elected and are to be included in the description. So are Innis, Marshal, Nicholas, Corbin, Gl. Jones, Zachy. Johnson, Stuart, White, Walter Jones, and probably a number of others in Counties not yet heard from. The principal characters on the opposite side are only Henry, Mason, Grayson, Harrison, Tyler & M. Smith, who will be reinforced by a few secondary characters of some influence. I say nothing of the Governour: because it is not yet certain which party will have most of his aid; nor of Monroe whose precise sentiments are not generally known. If I mistake not, he will be found not an enemy to the Constitution. A good deal may depend on the vote of Kentucky in the question. I have taken the liberty of stating to several gentlemen in that quarter my opinion that the constitutional impediments to improper measures relating to the Mississppi. will begreater as well as the pretexts for them be less under the new than the existing system; and that the former alone can promise any effectual measures either in favor of that object, or of a dispossession of the English of the posts, an object of still more immediate consequence perhaps to the district. I understand that hitherto the people there have been friendly to the Constitution. According to current report, a division of opinions is extending itself to them. I have not heard much from the Counties on the western side of the Alleghany. The Counties between that and the Blue ridge, have without an exception I believe, elected fœderal members. The main body of the antifederalists, lies as was conjectured on the South Side of James River. There appears however to be much less unanimity even there than was feared. Very low down the Counties have chosen fœderalists.\nPresent my compliments to the family if you please, and particularly to Genl Irvine & Col. Reed if they be still a part of it. With very sincere esteem & regard I am Dear Sir Your Obedt. friend & servt.\nJs. Madison Jr"

I had not been apprised of Mr. Mc.Donogh’s mission, and therefore could leave no directions about it. At present it seems to me impracticable that his recognition can take place till the President’s return to Philadelphia. This however need not detain him personally from going to Boston if he can leave his original commission in the hands of some one to be exhibited and returned to him. I do not see that any inconvenience can arise from this or even a delay of his functions, which being merely voluntary as to the British subjects themselves, are as likely to meet their acquiescence before as after our recognition.\nI thank you for your attention to the disposal of my house. I observe you name the sum of £27.10. The whole rent being £109–9 would be £9–2–5 a month. I believe I proposed to let it at half price, which would be £4–11–2½ a month, and for 7. months £31–18–5½. I do not mention this to make a difficulty if it has been settled at £27–10. but only to correct an error of calculation if it has been merely an error. I shall be glad to get any thing for the house. I wish Mr. Bruce would give me a discharge for that sum, or whatever sum they are to pay.—The little difficulties of Francis about bells, boards, tubs &c. are not worth a thought.

In the evening I went to the Comedy at the Bois de Boulogne.Beverlei and leFrançais a Londres were the plays represented. Beverlei is what the French call aTragedie bourgeoise, as Barnwell in English. The Subject of it is, a Man addicted to gaming, who ruins himself by it, or rather is ruined by a villain who pretends to be his Friend; and at last puts an end to his Life by Poison. It was intended to set the passion of gaming in its worst Light but the execution has not answered its Purpose, for it seems to encourage, a still worse passion; I mean suicide. However that was not the author’s intention. His design was very Laudable.Le Français a Londresis a Farce, calculated to show the difference of the French and English Characters and the author has carried both to a pleasing extravagance. I met at the Comedy, Mr. de Chaumont, whom I had not seen since I re­turned to Paris. He asked me a great many Questions, about Sweeden, Russia, Denmark, and all the Countries thro’ which I have been."

Is it not requiringextra servicesof Collectors wch. are quite independent of the defined duties of their offices, such as are not contemplated in the law under which they were appointed, and for which, consequently, no compensation is provided? Ought the labor or time of any man to be ask’d by the public for nothing? The Collectors, not having, like the favorite officers of Congress, the Loan Officers, who were on handsome salaries; any thing allowed them for Clerks wages, office rent, or extra services & expences, I consider every thing required of them, which is not defined, or comprehended in the latter part of the 6th. sectn. of the Collection law, as unjustifiable and oppressive, and with which, they are notobligedto comply. “They are to keep their books agreeably to forms prescribed &c.”This we do. “They are also tosubmittheir books &c. to theInspectionof such persons as may be appointed.” Very different this, from being called upon tofurnishsuch returns or statements from time to time, as those books & papersmightafford to such Officers of Inspection and which, are no ways connected with the accounts, which are to be transmitted as often as requiredfor settlement. They have no emoluments whatsoever, but what arises from business actually performed (for much of which, they are mainly paid) and are subject to all expences incidental to their Offices. How unjust then, that they should be liable, to be called upon to dosomethingfornothing?\nThese questions and observations are now, with great respect and humility, submitted to you, in order to enforce the propriety & equity, nay, the absolute Justice, of allowing the Collectors something in the way of Salary, as a compensation for extra services rendered to government, and for extra expences. For tho’ I am well convinced thatyourduty has & will frequently oblige you to call upon the Collectors to do things out of the line of their current, or defined duty (and in wch. I trust you will never be disappointed), yet, I am as well assured that, if you think me right, you have too much candor not to confirm my opinions, and too much Justice to withhold you endeavors to obtain proper & equitable provisions. If I am wrong, I feel a persuation, that your friendship for me, will not suffer me to remain so. And you know the great respect wch. I have, and ever shall be, disposed to pay to your opinions.\nBeing with the most sincere esteem, respect and friendship Dr sir Yr obt Srt\nW Heth\nThe Hnble Alex Hamilton Esqr."

You mention a declaration of the king’s published at Marseilles and annihilating the favors granted on whale oil. I have made diligent enquiry and cannot find nor suspect that any such measure has taken place. I have not asked of the ministers, because I would wish, if I do mention it to them, to be able to tell them what has been the nature of the declaration published as if from the king at Marseilles. I will beg you therefore to give me information of the exact particulars of this declaration. In the mean time I think I may assure you no alteration of the arrêt of Dec. 29. has taken place except the taking the right of entrepot from our cod-fish.—I will beg the favor of you to do for me what you think right as to the copy of the meteorological journal. I approve perfectly of the sum of five guineas which you propose to pay to the copyist. The moment you inform me it is settled at that, I will pay the money to Sr. John Lambert for you. I paid himthe former balanceof 272₶–5 before I set out on my journey, but had not then time to give you notice of it. I will beg the favor of you to put the inclosed letter under cover to Capt. Obrian chez M. Logie Consul Anglois á Algiers, without saying a single word from what quarter it comes to you, as a suspicion of that might produce effects I wish to prevent.\nI am desired by some gentlemen of South Carolina to procure to be sent to them some plants of the best species of Olive-trees. As Marseilles is the most convenient port for this, I must beg the favor of you to charge some gardener with the procuring and preparing these plants, and having them always in readiness to go by such vessel bound to Charleston as you shall be able to send themby. They lodge about 30. Louis in my hands to answer all expences, which will enable you to judge of the number to be sent. I would rather have so many sent as to exceed the sum rather than fall short of it, as I should wish to contribute five or ten guineas myself to the object. I suppose the plants cannot go till the fall or winter. There should also go a great quantity of the olives themselves, to be sowed on their arrival in Charleston in order to raise stocks whereon they may ingraft cuttings from the good plants. The same gardener may be charged to pack these olives properly. I presume Mr. Bernard could advise as to the best species of olive trees, and that he will be so kind as to do it. I shall have the honour of writing to himin a few days. I have that of being with my best respects to yourself & family, Sir, your most obedient & most humble servant,\nTh:Jefferson"

She took early, from the English ordonnance and Ammunition ships, and supplied herself in that Way, with those Articles when she had them not, and could not otherwise obtain them. She has taken in this Way a great Number of British and German Soldiers. She has taken a vast number of Seamen, who have generally inlisted on board our Privateers. She has taken great quantities of Provisions, Cloathing, Arms, and warlike stores. She has taken every Year, more and more Since 1775, and will probably continue to take more and more every Year while the War lasts. I have certain Intelligence, that there have been this year carried into Boston and Philadelphia only, Ninety Nine Vessells in the Months of July and August. On board of these Vessells there were not less than Eight hundred Seamen, many of the ships were very rich. The Vessells the English have taken from the Americans were of Small Value—this year they have been few in Number.\nI am not able to give you an exact Calculation. The Quebec ships were worth from thirty to forty thousand Pounds sterling each and there were two and twenty of them in Number.\nPrivateering is a great Nursery of Seamen, and if the Americans had not imprudently Sacrificed Such a Number of their Frigates and Privateers in the Attack and defence of Places, these alone, would by this Time, well nigh have ruined the British Commerce, Navy and Army.\nI have the Honour to be &c.\nJohn Adams"

I cannot resist expressing to you an idea which forcibly opperates on my judgment as very desirable on the present occasion.\nIt is well-known that Mr Steel is one of the warmest and most decided opponents to many of the measures heretofore adopted, And if he should by the Executive be enabled to have any agency in the treaty, I am of opinion it would have the effect contemplated. He will not be a member of the ensuing Congress. With perfect respect I have the honor to be sir, your obedient servant\nBenjamin Hawkins"

I think he might be assured that we will immediately enquire into these facts alone, & that being found true he may be assured that measures shall be taken for theliberationof the prisoner, altho’ he cannot be given up. should the judge finally retain cognisance of the cause, we ought to liberate by a pardon. the facts stated by mr Williams to you are corroborated by other information communicated to me. it will be necessary, at our first meeting, to take this matter into serious consideration. I think it would be better to return Haumont’s letter to the writer. we are not the judges what communications should be handed to the emperor of France. if the minister of marine thinks that Haumont’s work is of the nature of those things which the emperor does not chuse to be troubled with, we have no right to step between them. the communications of Irving are very interesting. they give hope as to the disposition to accomodate with us, but terror as to the price.

I Had Refused Every Public Emploïement that Had Been offered By the people, and still more Had I denied My Consent to My Being Appointed to Any Military Command—But When I saw our liberties and Constitution were seriously threatened and My Services Could be Usefully Emploïed in fighting for our old Cause, I Could no More Resist the Wishes of My Country Men, and as soon as the King’s Express Reached My farm I set our for Paris, from thence for this place, and dont think it Uninteresting for You, My dear General, to Add that I was Every where on the Road Most Affectionately welcomed.\nNow the Surrounding German Princes Have Submitted to dismiss Every Armed Corps of Refugees, to forbid Every Recruiting,Collecting, Equipping our Noble deserters, so that the poor fellows are Hunted By our Ambassadors from petty Courts to other Petty Courts—to Cut Short to Which, a formal Application will Be Made to the Emperor and diet of the Empire at Ratisbonne.\nMonsieur the King’s Brother Has Been Constitutionally divested from His Right to Regency—So will the Younger Brother—they as well as Prince Condi and some others are to Be tried for their life (in their Absence) Before a National Court—Indeed Measures Have Been Heaped, and Rather Hurried to throw them out.\nBut the Most important Part of our Business is to know what Part the Great Powers of Europe Will act—that Every one Of them Hates us is obvious—But Notwithstanding they would Crush us to Pieces, they are Affraid to touch us, least their Subjects Catch What they Call the french Evil—We Have Boldly Asked the Emperor for a Cathegorick Answer By the 10th of february—a Bill Has passed with the Sanction of the King, declaring it infamy, and High treason to listen to the Proposal of Any Alteration WhatSoever, Any Negociation With Respect to the Principles and letter of the Constitutional act.\nThe Army I Command Will of Course be the first to Act. I am to Have twenty thousand Men to Garrison the frontiers fromMontmedytoBitche,and thirty thousand to take the field—I do not Hope to Come up at first Quite to those Numbers.

Bligh. I immediately sent a few seeds to Virginia where I am in hopes there would still be force of summer sufficient to mature it. I reserve a little for next spring besides sowing some in pots, from which I have now 23. young plants just come up. I fear however there is not sumer enough remaining here to ripen them without the incertain aid of a hot-house. Upon your encouragement I think I shall venture to write to Mr. Hinton Este of Jamaica on the subject.—You will have known that we had lost Doctr. Franklin before your letter came to hand. Consequently the relation of Lt. Bligh’s adventure which you were so kind as to send, rests with me.\nThough large countries within our Union are covered with theSugar maple as heavily as can be concieved, and that this tree yeilds a sugar equal to the best from the cane, yeilds it in great quantity, with no other labor than what the women and girls can bestow, who attend to the drawing off and boiling the liquor, and the trees when skilfully tapped will last a great number of years, yet the ease with which we had formerly got cane sugar, had prevented our attending to this resource. Late difficulties in the sugar trade have excited attention to our sugar trees, and it seems fully believed by judicious persons, that we can not only supply our own demand, but make for exportation. I will send you a sample of it if I can find a conveyance without passing it through the expensive one of the post. What a blessing to substitute a sugar which requires only the labour of children, for that which it is said renders the slavery of the blacks necessary.\nAn act of Congress authorising the issuing patents for new discoveries has given a spring to invention beyond my conception. Being an instrument in granting the patents, I am acquainted with their discoveries. Many of them indeed are trifling, but there are some of great consequence which have been proved by practice, and others which if they stand the same proof will produce great effect. Yesterday, the man who built the famous bridge from Boston to Charlestown was with me, asking a patent for a pile engine of his own construction. He communicated to me another fact of which he makes no secret, and it is important. He was formerly concerned in shipbuilding, but for 30. years past, has been a bridge builder. He had early in life observed on examining worm eaten ships, that the worms never eat within the seams where the corking chissel enters, and the oil &c. He had observed that the whaling vessels would be eaten to a honeycomb except a little above and below water where the whale is brought into contact with the vessel and lies beating against it till it is cut up. A plank lying under water at a mill of his had been obliged to be renewed annually, because eaten up by the worm within the course of the year. At length a plank was accidentally put down which for some purpose had been thoroughly impregnated with oil. It remained seven years without being affected. Hence he took the idea of impregnating the timber of his bridges thoroughly with oil, by heating the timber as deeply as possibly, and doing it well in that state with the liver oil of the codfish. He has practised this for 30. years and there is no instance of the worm attacking his timbers, while those in neighboring places are immediately destroyed. He has used the liver oil of the cod because very thick, and therefore as he supposes more permanentin it’s effect. He supposes some other oils might do, but cannot speak of them experimentally. He sais there will be no difficulty in heating the planks of a ship after they are put on as well as before. But I do not recollect his mentioning ever to have tried it in the case of a ship.\nI am fixed here by the desire of my countrymen. Consequently less in the way of communications in letters and the arts than I used to be. The continuance of your communications in that way will now be received with double thankfulness.\nWe are told you are going to war. Peace and profit I hope will be our lot. A high price and sure market for our productions, and no want of carrying business will I hope enable my countrymen to pay off both their private and public debts. I am with sentiments of sincere esteem Dear Sir your sincere friend & servt.,\nTh: Jefferson\nP.S. The inclosed is so interesting to me personally, that I have taken the liberty of inclosing it under your cover, and asking the favor of you to send it by the first Paris Post."

The provisions which have been issued lately have been partly meat and partly fish, and a considerable part of them of a condition not fit for men to eat without endangering their health.\nI am compelled to add, that the brave men who are unfortunately subjects of the hospital, are of late obliged to eat salt provisions, very unfit for persons in their condition, and which tend rather to establish than contribute to the removal of their maladies. And further in general the troops are not properly supplied with that essential article, vinegar—so necessary to their health and comfort, especially when served with salted provisions. I have the honor to be, With the highest respect, Your Excellency’s Most obedient servant\nW. Heath M. General\nP.S.

It has this day been determined in his favour 18 vs.8.\nYou cannot imagine what horror some Persons are in, least Peace Should continue. The Prospect of Peace throws them into Distress.Their Countenances lengthen at the least opening of an Appearance of it. Glancing Gleams of Joy beam from thier Faces whenever all Possibility of it seems to be cutt off.— You can divine the Secret source of those Feelings as well as I.\nThe opposition to MrJay has been quickened by Motives which always influence every Thing in an Elective Government. Pretexts, are never wanting to ingenious Men. But the Views of all the principal Parties are always directed to the Election of the first Magistrate. If Jay Should Succeed, it will recommend him to the Choice of the People for President as soon as a Vacancy shall happen. This will weaken the hopes of the Southern states for Jefferson. This I beleive to be the Secret Motive of the opposition to him though other Things were alledged as ostensible Reasons: such as His Monarchical Principles, his Indifference about the Navigation of the Missisippi, his Attachment to England his Aversion to France, none of which are well founded, and his holding the office of C. J &c\nThe Day is a good omen: may the gentle Zephers waft him to his Destination and the Blessing of Heaven succeed his virtuous Endeavours to preserve Peace.— I am So well Satisfied with this measure that I shall run the venture to ask leave to go home, if Congress determines to sitt beyond the middle of May.\nMrAdams is to be Governor, it Seems by a great Majority of the People: and I am not Surprized at it.— I should have thought human Nature dead in the Massachusetts if it had been otherwise. I expect now he will be less antifœderal. Gill is to be Lt.— We will go to Princetown again to congratulate him.— I thought however that Gerry would have been the Man.\nWe are illtreated by Britain, and You and I know it is owing to a national Insolence against Us.

I impute it neither to Pride nor Prudence, because I am perswaded that if you had done me the Justice to wait my return to Town, the latter would have prevented you from giving me without cause the most uneasy sensations, I have felt, since I have been in Spain; and your own good sense, if not my conduct would have prevented you from being hurt in the former point.\nThe State of Facts will better remove your conclusions, which give me leave to say are hasty, than the present Situation of my mind will otherwise allow me to do. When In consequence of your directions, I showed to the Ct. de Montmorin your letter of the 22dto the Ct. de F Blanca, He was pleased to give me his opinion on the Subject of it & advice how to conduct myself when I delivered it, I listend to him with that attention which is due to his character and Connection with us, and thanked Him in the manner, which his apparent good Intentions demanded. This is the manner in which I consulted Him. He at the same time told me he was going to Town, and He will do me the justice to say, that I requested him to see you and repeat the Sentiments he had just mentioned to me.\nThe Journal which I shall have the honor to deliver you in Madrid, will show whether I was guided by his advice or not. If that is not Evidence, your first Conference with the Ct. de F B. may remove any doubts on that Subject.\nYou remember the proposition respecting the information to be communicated thro the Channel of France to^some one in England^, respecting MrCumberland & his supposed negociations,^upon^which you permitted me to consult the Embassador, This necessarily induced a conversation respecting him. With regard to the Chevalier & his knowledge of my attention in watching Cumberland, you will be pleased to recollect that I have more than once told^you^that, it was probable that the Same Person whom I particularly employed would communicate to the Embassador or Some one of his Family, in which He in a Manner lives, not only all I gleaned thro’ his means, but also most of what he knew respecting my Conduct in this business. I wasled to form this Conclusion from many questions put me by the Chevalier & if not positively denying the truth of his Information, be to communicate Intelligence I certainly communicated it, for I never will, if I can avoid it give, & that unnecessarily, to Persons with whom our Interest & consequently my Duty obliges me to be on Intimate terms either a bad opinion of my heart or head. I have endeavored to procure all the Intelligence that the Small sphere of my knowledge or acquaintance in this Country would allow me to obtain, & This I have always communicated to you almost Instantaneously. The use of it hath been left hitherto entirely to your discretion, and as long as I continue in Spain, I think, If I know myself, I shall not change my conduct. I never had but one Idea of our Commissions, which is still the same, That you are Minister & I Secretary. The second time I had the honor of seeing the Ctde Florida Blanca, I put the Copies of these commissions into his hands, of which circumstance I had the honor to inform you on our first Meeting at this Place, & when in Consequence of a reference in your Letter to MrGalvez to me for Information, The Ct. de F. Blanca sent me the queries I also gave you on your arrival at Madrid. I declined answering them, not only in respect to your Commission, but to your superior knowledge of the past and actual Situation of America, and altho on acctof your not arriving so soon as you was expected, I was more than once pressed on that Subject, I always declined answering them, alledging the Abovementioned Reasons—\nWhen I hinted to you the propriety of Countersigning your letters, I thought it customary, & you may Judge whether I had it much at heart. Since I do not recollect having mentioned it more than once. To be frank with you the Idea Struck me, from Seeing MrFergusons name countersigned to some of the Commissioners dispatches to Congress, on Reflection you must Allow, that I could have no Idea but the proper one of my Commission, from the single Circumstance of being desirous to sighn Myself Secretary at the foot of your Public Letters. I am sorry that your opinion of my understanding or Prudence induced you to think the restrictions you have made necessary. I shall however profit by the Circumstance, as it shows me the necessity of Scrutinizing severely my conduct, since it hath drawn upon^me^a censure, as unexpected as I hope it is unmerited. I immediately delivered your Letters for the CtDe F. B. to Monsr Del Campo, His Excellency not being at the Office, & told Him that I should set out for Madrid on Fryday evening & would charge myself with anythinganswer to these or your former letter which his Excellency might Judge proper to make. I waited on the CtD’Odunne on his arrival here & have seen him several times since. He has done me the honor to repeat the Same assurances which he made you in Madrid. I yesterdaypaid my respects to MrGalvez to take my leave of Him & was received with much Politness & many assurances of his disposition to be usefull to us. The Inclosed list of Delegates may be satisfactory to you. I beg you to make the proper Compliments for me to MrsJay & the Colonel and to beleive me with much respect Your Most Obedt. & Most Humble Servt\nWm. Carmichael"

I certainly cannot have the least objection but should be most sincerely glad to see you here, and that whilst Charles is with us. it would greatly add to my happiness if your sister could compleat the Number and I could see you all four once more together. I am very unhappy to be seperated from her during the absence of col Smith, who you must have been informd saild in the decbrPacket for England. his own situation, I mean that of holding an office which has as yet been an expence to him instead of a profit, an increasing Family and no profession by which he could help himself, prey’d heavily upon his spirits and induced him to take a step from which I hope he will reap a lasting advantage both to himself and Family I presume he is engaged with, and gone for, a Gentleman who knows what he is doing. he was ready to sail before either your Father or I knew that he was going, and went in five days after his agreement with the Gentleman. this you will keep to yourself the ostensible reason is that there were some debts due to his Fathers estate which he is gone to settle, and which is really the case. the publick Rumour is that Humphies is dead, and that he was sent in his place, but I believe the death of Humphries to be a mere speculation You will see by the Report of the Trustees to the sinking fund upon what a respectable footing our credit is, the 6 pr ct funded debt having risen to par & selling in Amsterdam at a hunderd and 24 for a Hundred. the state debt will rise rapidly provided a peace continues. they who have cash at command may be benefited by their purchases. they can scarcly buy a miss, I mean as it now stands.\nyou have made me very easy upon a Subject which I wrote to you upon from N york; I trust you will be convinced that all my anxiety was for your benifit and that your happiness will ultimately be the result of resolutions which you have wisely adopted, I have no doubt mean to adhere to, so that you shall hear no more from me upon that topick. amongst the many good Rules and Maxims of my worthy Grandmother with whom I chiefly lived during the early period of my life, I recollect with pleasure, that one of them was never to bring a painfull subject twice to recollection. if a poor culprit had transgresst, she repremanded with justice with dignity, but never lessned her Authority by reproaches. the concequence was that Love towards her and respect for her opinion prevented a repition of the offence—\nPoor Thomas has had a severe turn of the Rhumatism, five long weeks has he been confined to his chamber four of them totally helpless— a sympathising Parent who had realized the same painfull disorder you may be Sure, was more than commonly attentive to all his complaints and never left him an hour, Nights excepted till he was relieved Charles was of great service when he came & cheerd his spirits he had just enterd mr Ingersels office and commenced his studies when he was arrested by this cruel disease which I fear will unfit him for the Season and incapacitate him to persue them even at home for some time yet.

    "content": "Providence April 13th 1777.\nSir\nThe 5th Instant I received your Excellency’s Favor of the 12th Ulto; As I had previous thereto virtually comply’d with the Contents, can now only say, I delivered the inclosed Orders to Colonels Crary &Angell. From the first of January last, to the Rect of your Favor of the sixth, of March, the particular Command of the Post at Howland’s Ferry, Tiverton, devolved upon me by Order of General Spencer. The strict Attention necessary to be paid to that important Station, thirty two Miles Southeast from Providence, prevented me from knowing it was your Excellency’s Pleasure the Troops raising here should receive the small Pox by Innoculation. I never heard it mentioned ’till the Eighteenth Ulto, when I was honored with your first Favor. Upon the Receipt of it, I immediately left my Post, repaired to Providence, laid it before General Spencer, & the Governor & Council of War. It was not a positive Order; It was a Recommendation: It was not in my Power to act therefore, without the Approbation of those Gentlemen. They did not consent to the Measure at that Time, as they deemed the Troops essentially wanted for another Purpose. The Shores, in two or three Days after that, were almost destitute of Men, wch still delay’d the Innoculation. Genl Spencer daily expected Troops from Connecticutt; They did not arrive ’till about the Twenty eighth of March, when I recd your Order of the sixth, wch was the first absolute Order for my proceeding at all Events. Your Excellency has Seen by this Time, I presume, that your Orders of the sixth have been fully comply’d with. The Rout by me ordered was by Fish Kill, & so to Morristown. It is impossible therefore literally to comply with your Orders of the third instant, wch were this Evening received, I having just returned from the Hospitals, fourteen Miles from this Place. I should not have troubled your Excellency with this long Narrative of Facts, was it not to convince you, beyond a Doubt, that I have not been guilty of any, the least kind of Delay, wch needs an Excuse. Nothing could give me more disagreeable Pain, than your Excellency’s severe Censures, but a Consciousness of deserving them. Being perfectly free however from the latter, and as a full Knowledge of all the Circumstances will be sufficient to obliterate the former, I feel no Uneasiness about the Event, so far as it may respect me personally. I hope your Excellency will recollect your last Letter. Was I not convinced that the Contents originated from a Misapprehension of the Times when your Orders came to me, I should have esteemed them cruel beyond Expression. However, the common Maxim “Humanum est errare” may in some Degree apply to the first Character upon the Continent, as well as to that of a private Gentleman. Sir, I have no Commission from the Continent. Ever since my leaving Pumpton on the seventh of December, by Order of General Lee, I have not spent an Idle Hour, but in my sleeping Moments. My Command has been complicated, difficult and troublesome. In short, I have not had Leisure enough to correspond with a single Officer in the Western Army. And whatever Opinion your Excellency may formof me, I am positive that the Recruits have been forwarded and sent into Hospitals one Week sooner on Account of my particular Exertions. I can, with unremitted Attention, get e[ve]rything prepared for the March of the next Detachment, by the Time they will get thro’ the small Pox. No other Person here can effect it. The two Colonels are now in Hospital; Lt Colo. Comstock is unfit for Duty by means of having the small Pox severely; And Lt Colo. Olney Commands the Detachment sent forward —Your Excellency will consequently Judge, how necessary my Application to Business here may be. The General Assembly will set next Thursday; My Solicitations with them will possibly be attended with Advantage to the Service. Had not the Detachment marched a considerable Distance, I shoud proceed immediately to overtake them and alter their Rout; But as I am not order’d to proceed to Peeks Kill, I presume your Excellency will justify me in remaining where I am. General Spencer & the Governor, I conclude, will justify my past Conduct. If your Excellency should be satisfied, I shall be happy in religiously obeying your future Orders; If not, I can serve my Country in some other Way, as I imagine it is in your Power to withhold a Commission you may think me unworthy of. The next Detachment will consist of near two Hundred & fifty. Should any small Parties fall in, that have had the small Pox, previous to the March of Party now in Hospital, they shall be immediately sent forward. Since the Returns wch I inclosed Your Excellency, about forty Men have been recruited. I shall inclose Weekly Regimental Returns, as soon as I can procure them. Just as I am finishing this, your Excellency’s Favor of the Twenty ninth Ulto comes to Hand, upon perusing wch I find Nothing but what is answered in the foregoing, except your Directions concerning a Brigade Major. I have with me a worthy Young Gentleman, Major Sterry, who hath, with Reputation & Judgement acted in that Character in the State Service, the Winter past. I have the Honor to be your Excellency’s most obdt most humble Servt\nJ. M. Varnum"

Unfortunately, Sir, I am now under the disagreeable necessity to inform You, that the Yellow fever and black Vomit rages violently amongst the Crews of our Vessels, and some of the Citizens of The United States who are now in this City. Last week Captain Hills of Boston, who has left a Wife and family, was buryed, and within these few days Captain Carnes of the Ship Columbine of Boston, lost three of his Men, and this morning Captain Congdon of the Schooner Portsmouth, of Newport, Rhode Island, buryed one of his Crew, and numbers of our Seamen are confined to their beds on board t⟨he⟩Vessels and in the Hospitals. Lieutenan⟨t⟩John D Henley of the United States Navy⟨on⟩Furlough, now lies very ill at the House of m⟨y⟩Co-partner, Gray &⟨ ⟩. Their care & k⟨ind⟩attention will I hope save him. A Mr. Zon⟨ ⟩from New York, is so far gone, that his life⟨is⟩dispaired of; and I am apprehensive tha⟨t⟩many more of my Countrymen will fall vic⟨tims⟩to this cruel disease. I have not heard th⟨at⟩any other class of people than the Citizens of the United States have been attainted wit⟨h⟩this horrid distemper. Whether it is owing⟨to⟩their intemperate manner of living, which has been sometimes carried to excess, even her⟨e⟩and in the most fatal season of the Year,⟨is⟩what I cannot undertake to say, but I fe⟨ar⟩that example and danger will not teac⟨h⟩many of my Countrymen to be more modera⟨te⟩even in this critical moment, than at any other period. It is a melancholy truth, S⟨ir,⟩that at this hour I have not in the Office,⟨but⟩little more than One hundred dollars, to m⟨eet⟩the exigencies of our unfortunate Seamen, so⟨me⟩of whom are in the Hospitals at the fixed ra⟨te of one⟩half dollar per day. The passage from The United States to this Island is made in so short a time, that after deducting the Months advance which our Seamen receive, little is left to be paid them by their Captains; so that when they are carried to the Hospitals, they become in general a real charge to our Government. I promise You, Sir, that I will do every thing conformable to justice and Mercy, to economise the funds of the United States, now in, and that may come hereafter into my hands, though I doubt if I should have the resolution to refuse a Seaman a pass to an Hospital, notwithstanding I had not a cent in my possession of the Publick Money.\nMr. Ramage who leaves this in a little time for The United States, has told me that Mr. Hill owed a balance of near five hundred dollars to the Treasury of The United States, for monies received for Seamens discharges & Ca: And that He, Mr. Ramage, had also about two hundred dollars in his hands received on the same account, during the period of his filling the office, after Mr. Hills departure to my arrival, but Mr. Ramage is of Opinion that Mr. Hill has already settled at the Treasury for all sum⟨s⟩due by them, and Mr. Ramage having some⟨ac⟩counts to settle with Mr. Hill, will arrange w⟨ith⟩that Gentleman, on their meeting in the Uni⟨ted⟩States.\nMr. Ramage will perhaps pay a vis⟨it to⟩Washington, where he will no doubt give You,⟨Sir,⟩every satisfaction upon this subject.\nI shall continue to write You, Sir, a⟨nd⟩will acquaint You with the fatal effects of⟨the⟩Contagion which now reigns over our Unhappy Countrymen.

At the same time I submit to you an extract from my books, from which you will see, that my duty to my family, and to myself require a candid statement of my situation, as to the means of support not to say recompence which I have derived from my employment as surveyor of the public buildings during the last Year 1805\nAcct. currt., Salary as surveyor of public Buildings of theUnited States\n*This charge is unavoidable, as it is impossible for any architect to carry on such a Work as the Capitol without the assistance of a Clerk, in his own office, independently of the Clerk of the Works on the spot.\nThe above statement may be corrobarated by Vouchers, but the truth of the items are evident on the face of it.—From this it appears that had I remained in Washington six days longer in the course of last Year, the whole of my Salary would have vanished under the operation of deductions & expenses.—\nFrom the Naval department indeed I have received to the amount of 450$ chargeable to the business performed during the last Year, which being anaccidentalcompensation has rendered my professional engagements at Washington of more value,—and when the Treasury fireproof shall be compleated, I shall be further intitled to about 200$ Dollars more.\nOf the importance of my services to the public it is not my province to say any thing. With the difficulties which popular clamor creates in every transaction in which public money is to be paid, I am well acquainted, and wish to make no claims for any thing that is past. But I am convinced that you will forgive me, if under a view of the case I have presented to you, I suggest the wish that, in the attendance which the pressing state of work will during this Season require of me, I may be so compensated, as not to be an actual loser by the services I render, especially, as by retiring from business altogether, I could procure to myself infinitely more personal happiness, & preserve at least, what I actually now possess.\nMy ideas on this subject have been these. That an arrangement might be made, which, instead of the very uncertain compensation, for services to the Navy & other departments of government which I now receive, should give to me an inducement to reside principally at Washington, and to the government the right to call upon me on all occasions whatever,—either for Naval buildings, for advice on the construction of light houses,—fortifications &c, provided the advice given on the buildings erected were at the city.\nThe amount of my compensation ought not to be less, I conceive than 1,700 for the public buildings 1.300 for the naval department, & 500$ for the other departments, in all 3.500$. At 5 pcent on the money expended,—the established charge in other cases,—my commission on the public buildings would have been last Year 3,750,$—& in the Navy department, about 1.000$.—\nI now beg leave to submit most respectfully the above considerations,—assuring you,—that whatever may be the inconvenience or loss which I suffer, I will not withdraw myself from the strictest performance of my duty,—should you see reason to continue the present arrangement.\nI am with the truest respect Yours faithfully\nBHenryLatrobe"

However I can digest nothing, till I know the Premisses.\nIf the Plan of having only one here is adopted, it will be in my opinion absolutely necessary that maritime and commercial affairs should be put into other Hands, and the public Money too. The one who will be left here, is not sufficiently attentive to Business, to have So large a Field of it, nor Sufficiently parcimonious to have the Disposition of so much Money, in our <pernurious> necessitous Circumstances. This is not said from any unfriendly Motive for I have none: but it is impartial Truth, and such as the public Interest demands of me that I should tell.\nThe K’s Speech, I have already Sent to Congress by Several opportu­nities, you will see that he dreads the great Armaments of other Powers in the plural.

    "content": "Natchez 10th. June 1803\nDear Sir\nI am honored with yours of the 3d March. My unconfirmed state of health suffered some retardment from my attendance on theLegislature: itsnew positionchosen by the late assembly, altho’ tollerablein our climate for a summer Session, was found to be, during a very cold winter, without comfort or even common accommodation: my sufferings demanded considerable repose; want of bodily health induces habits of indolence upon the mind, and I am but just returning to my favorite amusements; I never the less enjoy the flattering prospect of returning health. My Sketch towards a history of the Missisippi therefore remains unfinished, but as the Whole has been long in the form of notes & memorandums, I shall be able soon to connect it so as to be fit to transmit.\nYou have done me the favor to communicate your ideas respecting the politicks of our Country; it was not my intention to introduce this Subject into any communications from me, knowing that your Governor and General here must keep you apprised of every event meriting notice: to those Gentlemen I have always communicated every intelligence (of any importance) which my acquaintance and correspondence with New Orleans may have brought early to my knowledge, with a view that it might be conveyed to you.\nThe reasons you assign for negotiating in preference to going to war, must be completely satisfactory to every unprejudiced person, if the object in view be solely the restoration of the deposit. Of the few persons in this Country who reflect, the greater part contemplate another object which they conceive to be of immense magnitude and which at a future day will powerfully operate upon the happiness of this great Continent. The french—an ambitious, enterprising and warlike people are preparing to scatter their myriads over these countries. we are informed that 30 thousand persons in france had obtained passports to migrate to the Missisippi, exclusive of those composing Genl. Victor’s expedition. They will create a great Nation speaking a different language from ours. It is true we consist of millions and they only of thousands, but a few years of uninterrupted prosperity will multiply them into a great people, sufficient for their own defence and capable of annoying the Neighbours. The West Valley of the Missisippi is greatly more fertile by nature than that on the side of the United States: that Country is undisturbed by those ferocious Savages who have with so much constancy and firmness retarded the progress of Civilised population on our Side. If then with every favorable circumstance, the French shall advance only in the known ratio of two to one in twenty years, their present population in Louisiana which we shall call only 60 thousand, will in 200 years, amount to more than 60 millions: it must be allowed that the uncommon Supplies of men to be expected from Europe must greatly anticipate the hour when those people will become formidable. Weshall thus have in one and the same Country, two great rival Nations speaking different languages; and experience has demonstrated that the rivalry of Nations is little short of a State of perpetual hostility; the immense number of fine navigable rivers furnished by our Country, so far from constituting natural boundaries become the natural bonds and connection of the People; and if hostilely disposed, greatly facilitate their reciprocal incursions; it would seem that immense Chains of rugged, barren & inhospitable Mountains are the most perfect boundaries and barriers in Nature.—How desireable—to preserve the whole of the Valley of the Missisippi for the spread of the people of the United States; who might in the progress of one Century, plant the fine Western Valley of the Missisippi with many millions of industrious inhabitants, speaking the same language with ourselves: it ought not to be objected, that this object is too remote to merit the contemplation of the present moment; it may be considered comparatively as at hand. Those who do not chuse to penetrate so far into futurity, are greatly alarmed by a danger which they conceive to be pressing. It is not doubted that the french Govt. has for some time fostered principles extremely innimical to the Govt. and general prosperity of the United States. By arts which they have reduced to a System their successful progress in Europe has been wonderful; they acquire by their superior talents and facinating address an ascendancy over the minds of a great part of a People, whose Govt. they intend to annihilate: their project becoming mature, the foreign Govt. must tamely submit to themediatorymandates of the great Nation, or if blind to the progress of french principles they attempt to rouse the people in defence of their Country, they fall an easy conquest to the superiority of french arms, the people receiving with open arms their pretended deliverers. There is no doubt, the french will attempt to play the same game with us. From the present good disposition of the mass of the people of the Western States, towards their own Govt. and a general detestation of french principles, a superficial observer might draw arguments unfavorable to any impression to be made upon us by the french; but who shall say, what influence a series of favors, indulgencies and immunities, with a crafty, conciliatory well directed conduct, may effect? the trade of france, no doubt, will be open to the Western people, their Commerce upon the Ocean will receive protection from the Navy of france, & no return will be exacted beyond what is paid by the ‘Soi disant’ Citizens of france. In due time the well chosen emissaries of ourSister Republic(who will not be sparing in the almighty influence of the precious metals) will create a party among the least virtuous but most clamorous of our Citizens;a false idea (already afloat) will be industriously inculcated that the interests of the Eastern and Western United States are opposed, and that an entire Separation will advance the prosperity of the Latter; by those and a thousand other wiles and stratagems, the integrity of our union will be attacked; with what success, time only will demonstrate: but I must confess, when I observe with what facility and indifference, many of our native Americans talk of flinging aside their allegiance and becoming the willing subjects of a despotic Government, I tremble. It may be said that those will still continue to be Americans and will in due time facilitate the acquisition of the Country. Such was my own opinion under the inactive and lethargic Govt. of Spain; but we cannot dissemble that our quondam friends (in the event of a war) will be but a few among the many, when mingled with the numerous & warlike bands of the french, and will be compelled to present the bayonet against the breasts of their fathers and brothers, or should their new Masters doubt of their fidelity (which is highly probable) they will be degraded into the rank of hewers of wood and drawers of water for the army, and thus throw an additional weight into the Scale of the Enemy, which a spirit truely patriotic ought to have preserved to ourselves. But how such mighty evils are to be prevented, must be left to the contemplation of the Sages of our Country. We cannot allege that we possess any right derived from the ordinary principles of human Justice or the law of Nations to inhibit the completion of a Contract made by two independent nations. But is there not a law in our favor superior to all others, the Divine law of Self-preservation? But even upon this principle, Violence is unjustifiable untill fair and honorable negotiation shall have failed.\nWe observe that an idea has gained ground in the U.S. that a Subaltern Intendant has dared to infract a solemn treaty between two Nations, without the positive command of his Court: this thought has not failed to excite a smile here among those who are intimately acquainted with Spanish polity and who know the precision of Conduct which pervades its departments, for of all Govts. certainly the Spanish is one of the most regular, methodical and correct; the rule of conduct of the principal officers is delineated so clearly, that they cannot deviate but with a certainty of punishment, unless sheltered under powerful protection. The only doubt among the few who have penetrated a little the secret, is whether the act has been done with or without the knowledge of the french Government; for my own part, I have believed, in consequence of several private reasons, particularly the information of some old friends near the Cabinet at New Orleans, that the transaction was brought forward without the privityof the Chief Consul: the idea I have formed & which I conceive to be upon solid ground, is, that the Spanish Govt. tremblingly alive to their own danger from the transplantation of a Colony or rather an army of rapacious frenchmen in the vicinity of their rich mexican possessions, have made a feeble attempt by the apparent insult of suspending the deposit, to stimulate the Americans to step forward for their relief: this being a matter of peculiar delicacy, putting to risk, the very existence of the Spanish Monarchy, it became necessary to conduct the measure with such profound privacy that it should be impossible for the french Govt. ever to penetrate the secret; a speedy revolution might have been the immediate consequence of the discovery. My ideas have been long since communicated to Genl. Wilkinson: it is scarsely supposeable that the Governor of New Orleans could tamely suffer his own dignity to be so far wounded as to permit an officer subaltern to himself, (& whose power extends only to the regulation of Commerce) to infract by an unauthorised act, a solemn treaty with a foreign nation, respecting which the Governor himself is the sole external organ. Governor Salcedo tells Govr. Claiborne in very obscure, I may, mysterious language; that he was himself opposed to the Intendant’s decree untill that officer presented to his view, the propriety of acting with circumspection and prudence, in order that they might be prepared against possible events which might spring from revolving occurrences; or words to that effect: those expressions do not in any sense apply to the continuance or suspension of the deposit, nor can we interpret them upon any other principle, but from the existence of some violent alarm in the minds of the Spanish Officers. Immediately after the promulgation of the Intendant’s decree, suspending the deposit; a great anxiety became evident in the minds of Govr. & Intendant, to dispatch a Confidential express to the Spanish minister near the U.S. and thefirst Clerk of the Secretary’s officewas chosen for the purpose, but after some reflection he declined being engaged in the service: a Mr.Powerwas afterwards applied to, and he asked (I think) 2000 dollars; the Govr. thought the sum too much, and while they continued to deliberate, the Express pilot-boat sent by the Marquis d’Yrujo arrived at New Orleans. Whether the Govt. at New Orleans transmitted the secret they wished to communicate, by the return of the Pilot-boat, or found it then too late, time perhaps may discover.—I will add one more circumstance which is perhaps a corroboration of my idea. It has been a policy of the Spanish Govt. to send occasionally into their Colonies, persons vested with supreme power to enquire into and remedy such evils and abuses as spring from the malversation of their officers: no suchDictatorial officer had ever appeared in Louisiana, yet at the moment when the Country was forever to be lost to Spain and when She could not be much interested in the existence of any abuses real or pretended within the Province, an Officer of the above description makes his appearance in New Orleans: he arrived (as customary) incog; he was extremely intimate with the Intendant, and I believe lived in his house; after remaining unknown a short time, he proclaimed his pretended Mission and exercised his authority in one or two slight cases, and soon after departed: it is difficult not to believe that this person was entrusted with a commission of the most private nature, widely different from that of the very unnecessary character with which he seemed to be alone invested: ashort time afterhis departure the proclamation of the Intendant was issued. Thelate order of the Spanish Court, tho’ apparently militating against the above idea, proves nothing but the imbecility and pusilanimity of that Govt. which cedes to every passing impulse. Disimulation has ever been a favorite engine in Spanish politicks, and when we reflect upon the depressed Situation of the Spanish Monarchy, goaded by the Govt. of france; the apparent inconsistencies which mingle in the transactions respecting the Suspension and restoration of the deposit are easily reconciled.\nIt is time I should apologise for having detained you so long, but my excuse must be found in my motive, which is a desire to inform you of a few circumstances which may hereafter throw some light upon present and future transactions. Politicks are not a favorite subject with me & I shall probably not introduce it again into our Correspondence, unless in the view of communicating something which may be important for you to know.\nWith the highest Consideration I have the honor to be Your Obedient Servant\nWilliam Dunbar"

Dowlin, commander of the American Privateer the Black Prince.\nIt appears to me from the above mentioned Papers, that the said Ship Flora is not a good Prize, the same belonging to the Subjects of a Neutral Nation: But that the Cargo is really the Property of the Subjects of the King of England, tho’ attempted to be masqu’d as neutral.\nI do therefore request that after the Cargo Shall be landed, you would cause the said Ship Flora to be immediately restored to her Captain, and that you would oblige the Captors to pay him his full Freight according to his Bills of Lading, and also to make good all the Damages he may have sustained by Plunder or otherwise. And I farther request that as the Cargo is perishable you would cause it to be sold immediately, and retain the Produce deposited in your Hands, to the End that if any of the Freighters, being Subjects of their High Mightinesses the States General, will declare upon Oath that certain Parts of the said Cargo were bonâ fide shipp’d on their own Account and Risque, and not on the Account or Risque of any British or Irish Subject, the Value of such Parts may be restored: Or that if the Freighters or any of them should think fit to appeal from this Judgment to the Congress, the Produce so deposited may be desposed of according to their final Determination.\nI have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient and most humble Servant.\nBFranklinMinister Plenipotentiary from theUnited States of Americaat the Court of France.\nTo Messrs. the Judges of the Admiralty at Cherbourg"

I wish to ascertain, if I could the Month and Day as well as the names of the Company. The Subject, all the time, was Independence. It made an impression on me, because it Seemed intended for my Instruction and Edification.\nThere is something in my Composition, which restrains me from Rancor against any man with whom I have once lived in friendShip. Mr McKean, is one among many of my old friends, who have been separated from me, by political causes. I cannot rejoice at the Embarrassment he is in, or the humiliation that Seems to be preparing for him. He is one of the last Men in the United States who could consistently with his Priciples or disposition, throw himself into the Arms of a democratic faction. It will be very curious, if Duane Should appear to be an over-match for him, and his friends. Yet even this may happen, in Pensilvania. McKean, Dallas and Coxe are not at home in the democratical pallace. They must be ejected from that House of Pride as Spencer describes it, or the House will be dividied against itself.\nI have not Seen an Aurora a long time: but last night I was told that in the late papers of Mr Duane, he or his Writers are elaborately answering my Defence, and recommending a Government in one Assembly. This coincides with your Account that the old Errors on the Subject of Government Learning and Lawyers are revived. There is a body of People in every State in the Union, who, are both in heart and head of this Sect. This tribe will always be courted by the Seekers of Popularity and opposers of a good Systematik Government. They are properly the Sans culottes of this Country. Whoever courts them and builds upon them, will find himself in the Situation of Danton, who made two Speaches on the Subject which reveal the whole Mystery. \"They now cry Danton and Robespierre, Said he but the moment they change the order and cry Vive Robespierre and Danton, off goes my head.\" Another Saying of Danton was this. \"They have driven us into the Arms of the Sansculottes, and Sansculottism has destroyed France: it has ruined Us all; and will very Soon destroy itself.\" Danton, however, was not the first nor the last Demagogue who has gone down into the Pit with his eyes open.\nIt would indeed Seem as if mankind were, destined to be Slaves, as you told me, I said 30 years ago, All History and all Experience Seem to evince such a tendency. There is Liberty however, and there has been, in some Ages and Countries: and if this fact is admitted, Wise Men Should never despair, but always remember that no Effort will be lost. When I Said “the Sooner they fulfill their destiny, the better, I Said as peevish and extravagant a Thing as Brutus did, When he Said he found Virtue but a Shadow, though he had worshiped her all his days as a Goddess. Such foolish Escapes of ill humour ought not to be remembered; or if not forgotten they ought to be reprobated.\nPensilvania is not alone. Every State in the Union is, in her case, in a larger or Smaller degree. Patriotism in this Country must be tinctured with English or french devotion or be without Support, and almost without friends. Independent unadulterated impartial Americanism is like Hayleys Old Maid, a decayed tree in a vast desert Plain of Sand or like Burke’s old Oak, torn up by the roots and laid prostrate by the late Hurricane:\nEvery State in the Union has a party, like your \"old wealthy native Citizens,\" who are Still Englishmen in their hearts, and will afford a mere American no Support. These factions from the Mississippi to St. Croix, have made it a fixed Principle, all along to hunt down every true American and every Revolutionary Character, as Soon as they possibly could, and get them out of their Way. They were all in one of these Parties taught to turn their Eyes for this purpose upon that Scottish Creole Alexander Hamilton as their head, and what he was to do with them or what they were to do with him I will not at present Conjecture; but I have an opinion, which may one day be develloped. Probably it went no further than an Alliance with England, and an alienation from France, without well considering what must have been the necessary Effect of such a Plan. In this they fundamentally departed from my system, and my Maxim, which you know I have preached and inculcated for thirty Years and which Jefferson has been mean enough to Steal from me, and display as his own, “Friendship and Commerce with all Nations Alliances with none.” Washington learned it from me too, as you very well know, and practiced upon it, as far as he could, to my certain knowledge and by my constant advice at a time when he consulted me in every thing to the infinite Jealousy of Hamilton. Your Lady’s father Judge Stockton, Knew very well that this was my Maxim on the day of the vote of Independence, and his son Horatio, seems to have heard it from his Father, for he wrote with more cognizance de cause, at a certain critical period, than any other Writer in America. Even he however was too fulsome to Washington. I am always mortified when I See my Administration, Supported by the Name, Opinion or Authority of that Man, great and good, as he certainly was. If my Conduct cannot be justified by Reason, Justice and the public good, without the Smallest Aid from the Prejudices or Caprices of the People, or from the Judgment of any Single Individual on Earth, I pray that it may be condemned.\nThe human Understanding is very well in the ordinary Affairs of Life. In Architecture, Men consider the Elements about them, the Earth, the Air, the Water and the fire, and construct their houses very well to guard against the Dangers and Inconveniences of each. In Dress, in Furniture in Equipage, they consult nature tolerably well, and provide for their Comfort and Decency. But in Goverment they Seem to be destitute of common sense. The Nature of men and Things is laid out of the question. Experiment which is admitted in all other Arts and Sciences is wholly unheeded in this. A Strange Disposition prevails throughout all stages of Civilization, to live in hollow trees, and Log houses without chimneys or Windows; without any division of the parlour from the Kitchen or the Garret from the Cellar.\nI cheerfully agree to confine your Letter to my family upon condition that you confine mine to yours. For mercy sake dont hint any thing from me to Tench Coxe or Tom Paine, to Pierpoint Edwards or Dr Dana\nMy Family join in Love to yours, with you old Friend / and faithfull servant,\nJ. Adams"

    "content": "PhiladaOct. 9. 1823.\nDear Sir\nYour kind favor of the 8thultowas waiting for me here, & I received & read it with those feelings which I always experience in what comes from you. I am under real obligation for the manner in which you have allowed me to substitute the next summer for this fall. For independently of the full sufficiency I have had of locomotion for the present, another obstacle would have presented itself to my travelling at present off of the pavement of the City; the universal spread of disease throughout this whole country & more especially in those regions hitherto the most remarkable for their healthiness. Although I have not heard that this unprecedented & inexplicable state of things has reached Monticello or its neighborhood, yet it is known, & published in all the papers, that it occupies whole districts through which it would have been necessary to pass.The whole neighborhood of Philadelphia including the heights of Germantown & the mountainous region beyond it, has as regularly established a Country-fever as the Rice swamps of Carolina—At the same time those who remain on the pavement of the City & do not risk themselves even in the suburbs, enjoy an uncommon degree of exemption from disease. Should thismalariagain the City next year, as it seems to be making a regular progess here similar to that observed of late years at Rome, I really see nothing to be done but to fly by sea from this deadly foe . It has already entered the outskirts of the City—We hope thatfortwill check it for the present—but as everything in this new disorder seems to be[. . .], it is possible the fort may now act as aconductorinstead of destroyer.\nIf you knew my real disposition & present habits of life, you would not suppose that any “flitting & joy & semblage” at the New York watering places, could be as agreeable to me as the “plain & sober family & neighborly society” I should find with you. Years have had their customary affect on my taste & disposition—& I have now arrived to consider perfect repose as thesummon bonumof life, & to appreciate thedolce far nienteof the Nations.\nWhat you say of the progress of the University gives me the greatest pleasure Everything combines to make me take a sincere & heartfelt satisfaction intheprospectsofthat institution. Its being directed to the cultivation & improvement of the human mind would suffice of itself—but its being located in my native state, to which I am proud to belong—& in a district to which I have ever remained partial from early associations, add to it also.I cannot help fearing for it, the growing influence of the Presbyterian principles in the Legislature. That sect, which I consider as Protestant Jansonists, will vigorously oppose it, I apprehend, on every ground—& to that end will avail themselves of the popular objection to the importation of the Professoruniques from abroad—an evil, if it be one, for which I see no remedy. I had in store for you here a Professor of Mathematics. It may be considered as in this country, or at least by the side of Bowditch—But when I counted on himhe waspoor, & I have no doubt would have accepted the offer most willingly—I doubt it much now, as he is well placed in a life insurance office, where he is indispensable to them, & where they would probably make his place still more agreeable & profitable rather than lose him.\nI have nothing to apprehend any where from the “wrangling about the next President”—I am too little acquainted with the several candidates to list any of that highlyexcitedinterest, which arises from attachmant to persons rather than principles—My first wish is that he who shall be chosen may be so indisputably chosen, that contending parties can by no possibly hang a doubt on the choice. It has always appeared to me that this is the fragile part of our institution, & past experience even has not given me any assurance—What has taken place has been merely, as it strikes me, in the way of the Abbé Gabanci “rafle de six” Theraflehere has come as yet only three times, & he allowed four times, before his friend Diderot was to lose patience. Should ourraflecontinue I shall like the Abbé, believe that Providence has interfered in the business.\nI admit only of one newspaper into my room—I found when I had several that they took up too much of the morning or theavantdosiee, the only time that I now devote to serious occupation or study—But I see the Richmond Enquirer whenever I wish it, at the Athenaeum, an institution of which I am one of the founders, & where I pass a part of almost every evening. There are so many papers there, & there is so much in the Enquirer, that I by no means see the whole of each number, but I have always found it among the most ably edited of our papers.\nYou gratify me beyond expression, in what you say of the “only blot.” I formerly, before my first return to America, had indulged myself in several theories & in very sanquine hopes on this subject, some of which I think I must have communicated to you at the time. I remember that among other things, I had left by my will a certain amount of the 3. pctstock of which the income was to be forever applied to the purchase& liberationof females of that caste. I hoped others would follow this example by a calculation some what in the way of the Jesuite Pere Potau, I found the whole race would be free in a few generations—I did not then foresee the greatest of all the difficulties—what was to be the consequence after they had been thus liberated.I must own that since my return & residence in America I have considered all such efforts as mere visions. An inseperable difficulty must ever be found in this, that every reform must depend precisely on those whose prejudice & whose interests are the most opposed to, & would be the most likely to be the alarm of, anysquintingstowards a reform. Until I shall see the Members of the Holy Alliance awaking out of their present[. . .]& reforming their own abuses of themselves,I own I shall hardly expect to see our Legislature acting in that way[. . .]indeed if I were called upon to say what ought to be done, I own also, I should be obliged to confess my ignorance. To think of a total reform or a general emancipation I should consider the worst species of madness.[. . .]of[. . .]however I think much might be done without danger, towards raising this caste in the scale of being & independentlyrisking their sufferings—Such for instance as assimilating their condition to the Serfs of Europe. I reflecteda great deal on this matter when formerly in Europe, but my observation here has convincedmethat nothingofthis kind will be ever attempted.I have never spoken of it to any of my southern friends, merely as[. . .]academical question, without percieving that it was impossible to induce them to give it memoments[. . .]& calm reflexion.“Les magens d’execution” might & probably would present many difficultieswhich[. . .]do not now present themselves to me; yet I see no other road so likely to lead to any desirable result, &[. . .]which I should so much wish to see attempted.\nI wish I could by any means know your sentiments on thismatterknowing how many friends & correspendents you havetoattend to, it would be unreasonable in me to ask you to[. . .]to me on it. I cannot however terminate this long letter without adding how much gratification I derivefromyour letters & above all when they tell me that you are well. This is a pleasure I never fail toshare withyour friends here, & this I hope will induce you to give it to me as often as you can do it without too much[. . .]& inconvenience to yourself—For after all, it is your ease, your convenience, your health & your happinesswhich ever form the first wish & desire of, dear Sir,\nW: Short"

They must be sensible of the high prices of sugars, liquors &ca among us, and of the certainty of making a vast profit, should they be able to sell them to the Country at large.

This circumstance, independant of the desire I have to repay the Money borrowed in this State Makes it indispensably necessary to collect my Ren[t]—My debts—and to use every means possible to raise money to answer this purpose. I have already mentioned Robt Alexander[’s]debt—he has not the smallest pretensions to further endulgence—& there may be other debts (which do not strike me at this moment) the payment of which may be demanded with equal propriety. to enable me to judge of this, I shall be obliged to you to send me a list of My Bonds—(I suppose Mr Custis took all his after the settlement made by Colo. Mason—) the Sums for which they are given—and what Interest is due on them. I used, if I recollect right to keep a list of the Ballances when I settled My Accn. if this is to be found in my Ledger, & no alterations have taken place since, I wish to have a copy of this also.\nAs it does not appear that you had any notice from Mr Randolph (the Attorney General) to whom I had committed the management of the business relative to the Affairs of Colo. Mercer & his Mortgagees—nor no authentic information or proof of Mr Jno. Mercer’s having complied with the requisition of the Court respecting the security, I think you acted with proper caution in withholding the Bonds—but as there can be no doubt of the decree and as I wish very much to get quit of the business, it is my earnest desire that the Bonds and other Securities and Money (if any there be) in your hands may be given up When he has done this, and upon the passing of a proper Receipt for them. An acct should also be rendered of the money that has been received and how applied. that the produce of the Sales agreeably to my report thereof to the Court May be accounted for. This is all the Decree requires of me, nor should I be willing to give up (more than Copies of) the Sales and other Original Papers; depriving Myself thereby, if it should hereafter be found necessary, of the only means by which a proper account of my transaction of this business could be rendered. The Attorney General has been furnished with Copies of the Power of Attorney under which I acted. Accts of Sales in Berkeley—also of those in Loudoun, with a Memorandum respecting the Latter & the purchaser;, from whom Mr Mercer conveniently can—if it is necessary—obtain Copies at any time. The only Money that has ever passed through my hands was the Bills you sent me in Jan. 7. 1780 for Intert of Loan Office certificates—amounting to 1392 Dollars which were sold in Phila. by Chs Petitt Esqr.: at my request, and the money placed in the Virginia Funds agreeably to the request of James Mercer Esqr. I say this from the information of Mr Petitt, who wrote me to this effect. the Bills sold at 35 for 1.\nThat you may be certain of pursuing a proper, and cautious conduct on this occasion, I have requested the Attorney General, as you will see by the Inclosed Letter to him, left open for your perusal—& to be sealed & forwarded immediately by Post—to give you his Sentiments. There should be a particular enumeration of the Bonds and other Papers which are surrendered—a lumping receipt may be liable to exceptions from the generality of it, in case of disputes hereafter.\nIf you purchase the Young horse belonging to the Estate of Mr Custis, I should be glad to get him; and shall think it rather hard if so small a part of my Debt cannot be received by way of discount, when I am willing to forbear and have not the smallest intention of putting the Estate to the least inconvenience to pay what it owes me. On this Subject I wrote Mr Dandridge a Post or two ago; but if the Sale did really take place on the 20th agreeably to the advertisement, I do not suppose the Letter reached him previous to it. I should have been well pleased to have got both the Horses; but readily relinquished one that the produce of the Sale might be applied to the wants of the Estate.\nI observe what you say respecting the Flowering Shrubs and other Ornamental Trees at the No. end of the House—and as the locusts by the goodness of their growth may lay claim to an establishment there—I wish that the aforementioned Shrubs & ornamental & curious trees may be planted at both ends that I may determine hereafter from circumstances and appearances which shall be the grove, & which the Wilderness. It is easy to exterpate Trees from[any]spot but time only can bring them to maturity.\nIn a drawer, in the Locker of the Desk which stands in my Study, you will find two small (fore) teeth; which I beg of you to wrap up carefully, & send inclosed in your next Letter to me. I am positive I left them there, or in the secret drawer in the locker of the same desk.\nMrs Washington & Myself are sorry to hear that Mrs Washington has been delivered of a dead Child, but very glad to find she is so well after it.

Orleans, stating the progress & prospects of their enterprize. in this the US. feel a strong interest inasmuch as it will so much facilitate the passage of our armed vessels out of the one water into the other. for this purpose however there must be at least 5½feet water through the whole line of communication from the lake to the river. in some conversations with mr Clark on this subject the winter before last there was a mutual understanding that the company would compleat the canal, & the US. would make the locks. this we are still disposed to do: and so anxious are we to get this means of defence compleated, that to hasten it we would contribute any other encouragement within the limits of our authority which might produce this effect. if for instance the completion of it within one year could be ensured by our contributing such a sum as one or two thousand D. a month to the amount of 20,000. D. in the whole, we might do it, requiring as a consideration for our justification that the vessels of the US. should always pass toll-free. the object of this letter is to get you to sound the principal members, without letting them know you do it by instruction from us, & to find out what moderate & reasonable aid on our part would be necessary to get a speedy conclusion of the work, and in what form that aid would be most useful, and to be so good as to communicate it to me as soon as the knolege is obtained by yourself. I should be glad to learn at the same time what is the perpendicular height of the top of the levée above the surface of the water in the Misipi in it’s lowest state. 5½feet below this would be indispensible for our purposes. I salute you with great esteem & respect.\nTh:Jefferson."

    "content": "Philada. Decr. 5th. 1780\nDear Sir.\nI had yours of the 25th. Ulto. by yesterdays post. I congratulate you, on the deliverance of our Country from the distresses of actual invasion. If any unusual forbearance has been shewn by the British Commanders, it has proceeded rather I presume from a possibility that they may some time or other in the course of the war repossess what they have now abandoned than from a real disposition to spare. The proceedings of the Enemy to the Southward prove that no general change of system has taken place in their military policy.\nWe had letters yesterday from Mr. Jay & Mr. Carmichael as late as the 4 & 9th of September. Mr. Jay informs us that it is absolutely necessary to cease drawing bills on him; that 150,000 drs. to be repd. in three years with some aid in cloathing &c is all that the Court will advan[ce] for us. The general tenor of the letters is that our affairs there make little progress, that the Court is rather backward, that the navigation of the Mississippi is likely to prove a very serious difficulty, that Spain has herself been endeavoring to borrow a large sum in France on which she meant to issue a paper currency, that the terms & means used by her displeased Mr. Necke[r] who in consequence threw such discouragements on it, as in tur[n] were not very pleasing to the Spanish Minister, that Mr. Cumberland is still at Madrid labouring in concert with other Secret Emissaries of Britain to give unfavorable impressions of our Affairs, that he is permitted to keep up a correspondence by his Couriers with London, that if negociations for peace should be instituted this winter, as Spain has not yet taken a decided part with regard to America England will probably chuse to make Madrid rather than Versailles the seat of it. However unfavorable many of these particulars may appear, it is the concurrent representation of the above Ministers that our disappointment of pecuniary succour at Madrid is to be imputed to the want of ability and not of inclination to supply us, that the steadiness of his Catholic Majesty is entirely confided in by the French Ambassador, and yt. the mysterious conduct of Mr. Cumberland and of the Court of Spain towards him, seems to excite no uneasiness in the Ambassador. The letters add that on the pressing remonstrances of France & Spain Portugal had agreedto shut her ports against English prizes, but that she persisted in her refusal to accede to the armed neutrality.\nThe recipt of the foregoing intelligence has awakened the attention of the Georgia Delegates to their motion of which I informed you particularly by Col. Grayson. It has lain ever since it was made undisturbed on the table. This morning is assigned for the consideration of it, and I expect it will without fail be taken up. I do not believe Congress will adopt it without the express concurrence of all the States immediately interested. Both my principles & my instructions will determine me to oppose it. Virga. & the United States in general are too deeply interested in the subject of controversy to give it up as long as there is a possibility of retaining it. And I have ever considered the mysterious & reserved behaviour of Spain, particularly her backwardness in the article of money as intended to alarm us into concessions rather than as the effect of a real indifference to our fate or to an alliance with us. I am very anxious notwithstanding to have an answer to my letter by Grayson.\nWe had a letter yesterday also from Mr. Adams who was at Amsterdam; and several others from him a few days before. Searl who carried despatches relating to the object of Mr. Laurens’ Mission had fortunately arrived; though Mr. Adams gives no very sanguine idea of a successful result. The news of the fate of the Quebec & Jamaica fleets arrived in London pretty nearly about the same time and had a very material effect both on stocks and on ensurance.\nInformation from the W. Indies gives a tragical picture of the effects of the tempest. Martinique has suffered very considerably in their Shipping and Seamen. The English have certainly lost the Ajax a Ship of the line & 2 frigates stationed off St. Lucie to intercept the Martinique trade with almost the whole of their crews, and there is great reason to suppose that several others which are missing have shared the like fate. St. Lucie is entirely defaced. In Barbadoes scarce a house remains entire, and 1500 lives at least are lost. One of the largest Towns in Jamaica has been totally swept away and the insland [island or inland?] otherwise greatly damaged. The Spaniards too on Cuba have not escaped, and there is areportthat their fleet on its way to Pensacola has been so disabled & dispersed, that the expedition is for the present frustrated. This morning’s paper which I this moment looked into has I perceive [a more par]ticular acct. of the disaster in W. Indies than I had befo[re read but] the St. Lucie paper says nothing of the loss of the Ajax &. but only tha[t] they were driven to sea[.] I am less confidentas to the fact, though it might be intentionally omitted or not known there.\nIt is not without reluctance that I trust this to the conveyance by post. If I had less experienced his punctuality in our correspondence or knew of a better opportunity I should act otherwise. As it is I consider the importance of your knowing the particulars from Spain as a ballance for the risk.\nWe have in Town at present several gentlemen of distinction from the French army. Among them the Chev: de Chatteleux the 2d. in comman[d] a man of sense politeness & letters. The Viscompt de Noailles brother in law to the Marquis de la fayette, and Baron de Montesquieu grand son to the great Montesquieu. I hope I shall soon hear of your taking up the back lands & the confederation. I have not time to consult Dunlap.\nAdieu.\nJ. Madison Jr."

Not finding—after the arrangement of this matter with the Secretary of War—your name in the list of nominations and appointments (announced by the Papers)—I wrote to him to be informed of the cause; and received the following answer.\n“I inclose the Act to augment the army of the U.S. You will see that it does not provide for a Quarter Master General, and that the Provisional Army Law provides that the Qr Mr Genl under it shall have the Rank & pay of Lt Colonel only. I thought it best therefore that no Quarter master General should be appointed ’till Congress meet again when they may amend their Act.”\nThis explanation, though I regret the cause, will allow you the time you seemed to wish, to make other arrangements—unless an actual Invasion (which I do not think probable) or such demonstrations of it as cannot be mistaken, should call us all to arms, in which case I am persuaded you would be among the last to stand upon punctilio.\nWhen the Secretary of War was at this place, the Bill for augmenting the Army of the U.S. was then pending in Congress; and before he got back to the Seat of Government it had passed, and Congress had adjourned. This will account for the unfinished State in which (to my surprise I confess) the important Department of Quarter Master was left.\nI felt it incumbent on me to give you these details, lest my former letter, & attempt to embark ⟨you in⟩ the service, should, ⟨on the face of it, appear to⟩ be more strongly marked with precipitancy than discretion.

I wish it may not turn out, that the whole of his Regimt has been cut off, as the accounts seem to have left matters in a very doubtful & disagreable situation. These incursions & depredations of one settlement after another are infinitely distressing—and if possible, I should be happy to check ’em effectually. I have ordered the remainder of Clintons Brigade to move immediately to Albany —and I would wish you to consider with Genl Hand, whether it will be practicable for it, in conjunction with the other troops in that quarter, to prosecute any offensive operation this season. If it will not, you will be so obliging, as to advise with him on the disposition that should be made of the Troops, so as to give the most extensive security to the Frontiers and having regard to their own safety. Besides the troops now going to Albany—I ordered Count Pulaski some days ago to march to the Minisincks with his Legion consisting of about 250 Horse and foot, which will be reinforced by Armand’s & Spencer’s Corps, amounting to about the same number. This force you will have in view—in your deliberations, and also Colo. Cortlandt’s Regiment, which is now between Minisincks & Rochester.\nYou will not be unmindful of the Canada intelligence—I am persuaded; and I must request the earliest exertions in your power to obtain it.\nI have directed the Quarter Master Genl to set the saw mills to work about Fort Ann & Fort Edward—& shall be happy in your advice to Colonel Lewis upon the occasion.\nThe Enemy still remain in New York and at Rhode Island—and it would seem from the lateness of the season and other circumstances—that they mean to winter there—yet there are some things, which favour a hope to the contrary.\nThe Winds of late have been very violent. On the 31st Ulto the Sommerset of 64 Guns was drove on shore on the south side of Cape Cod & her Crew made prisoners. There is also a report that three more of the fleet are lost on Nantucket Shoals.

    "content": "Nice, April 11, 1787.\nYour head, my dear friend, is full of Notable things; and being better employed, therefore, I do not expect letters from you. I am constantly roving about, to see what I have never seen before and shall never see again. In the great cities, I go to see what travellers think alone worthy of being seen; but I make a job of it, and generally gulp it all down in a day. On the other hand, I am never satiated with rambling through the fields and farms, examining the culture and cultivators, with a degree of curiosity which makes some take me to be a fool, and others to be much wiser than I am.I have been pleased to find among the people a less degree of physical misery than I had expected. They are generally well clothed, and have a plenty of food, not animal indeed, but vegetable, which is as wholesome. Perhaps they are over worked, the excess of the rent required by the landlord, obliging them to too many hours of labor, in order to produce that, and wherewith to feed and clothe themselves. The soil of Champagne and Burgundy I have found more universally good than I had expected, and as I could not help making a comparison with England, I found that comparison more unfavorable to the latter than is generally admitted. The soil, the climate, and the productions are superior to those of England, and the husbandry as good, except in one point; that of manure. In England, long leases for twenty-one years, or three lives, to wit, that of the farmer, his wife, and son, renewed by the son as soon as he comes to the possession, for his own life, his wife’s and eldest child’s, and so on, render the farms there almost hereditary, make it worth the farmer’s while to manure the lands highly, and give the landlord an opportunity of occasionally making his rent keep pace with the improved state of the lands. Here the leases are either during pleasure, or for three, six, or nine years, which does not give the farmer time to repay himself for the expensive operation of well manuring, and therefore, he manures ill, or not at all. I suppose, that could the practice of leasing for three lives be introduced in the whole kingdom, it would, within the term of your life, increase agricultural productions fifty per cent; or were any one proprietor to do it with his own lands, it would increase his rents fifty per cent, in the course of twenty-five years. But I am told the laws do not permit it. The laws then, in this particular, are unwise and unjust, and ought to give that permission. In the southern provinces, where the soil is poor, the climate hot and dry, and there are few animals, they would learn the art, found so precious in England, of making vegetable manure, and thus improving these provinces in the article in which nature has been least kind to them. Indeed, these provinces afford a singular spectacle. Calculating on the poverty of their soil, and their climate by its latitude only, they should have been the poorest in France. On the contrary, they are the richest, from one fortuitous circumstance. Spurs or ramifications of high mountains, making down from the Alps, and as it were, reticulating these provinces, give to the vallies the protection of a particular inclosure to each, and the benefit of a general stagnation of the northern winds produced by the whole of them,and thus countervail the advantage of several degrees of latitude. From the first olive fields of Pierrelate, to the orangeries of Hieres, has been continued rapture to me. I have often wished for you. I think you have not made this journey. It is a pleasure you have to come, and an improvement to be added to the many you have already made. It will be a great comfort to [you to know, from your own inspection, the condition of all the provinces of your own country, and it will be interesting to them at some future day to be known to you. This is perhaps the only moment of your life in which you can acquire that knolege. And to do it most effectually you must be absolutely incognito, you must ferret the people out of their hovels as I have done, look into their kettles, eat their bread, loll on their beds under pretence of resting yourself, but in fact to find if they are soft. You will feel a sublime pleasure in the course of this investigation, and a sublimer one hereafter when you shall be able to apply your knolege to the softening of their beds, or the throwing a morsel of meat into the kettle of vegetables. You will not wonder at the subjects of my letter: they are the only ones which have been present to my mind for some time past, and the waters must always be what are the fountain from which they flow. According to this indeed I should have intermixed from beginning to end warm expressions of friendship to you: but according to the ideas of our country we do not permit ourselves to speak even truths when they may have the air of flattery. I content myself therefore with saying once for all that I love you, your wife and children. Tell them so and Adieu. Your’s affectionately,\nTh:Jefferson]"

Liberty was never placed in a less hazardous Situation, than in our States, and our inattention to her protection would therefore be the more criminal. I think the general Conduct of your House is calculated to Secure her, but there is a wide & secret inlet of mischief in our manners, that if not controlled, will make legislative Forms of no avail. The restraining of the ruinous adoption of European Fashions, to which our people are So prone, the farther Compulsion to Frugality, by a Strict distribution of Justice, and the Stifling the Birth those impudent upstart pretensions to European Ranks, which Some men affect, will be powerful means; because they tend to preserve the materials Sound, and not merely to patch up rotten parts.\nI have long been persuaded that the States to the north East of Susquehana,with few Exceptions, tended fast to a Mixture of oligarchy & anarchy, & your observations go far in explaining the Causes—but I am also of opinion, that virga. is the great repository of republican principles—the absence of great Towns, the Equality of Rights in the Holders of the Soil, the close gradation in Quantity possessed by a numerous Race of Land-holders, the Existence of Slavery & other Circumstances, form such Strong Barriers to republicanism as will be very difficult to be broke thro. A Separate Confederacy, which I have hitherto abhorred, may one day,possibly, be a means of preserving our Liberty by an union of parts more homogeneous in their Nature, than the present may eventually be. Have you considered the actual Effects of the Law of Descents? I fear it will have an Effect directly opposite to what was intended, & that it will tend to abolish many of those Links in the Scale of real property which I esteem such a firm Barrier to our freedom. When I mention Slavery as one of the Securities of our Liberty a respect to your opinion, Should have produced some explanation of my Sentiments thereon; but as I am much in haste I will at present take my leave of you with the Esteem & regard with which I am dear Sir your Mo. obed Sevt.\nWalt: Jones"

    "content": "Washington July 5. 1803.\nSir\nHaving occasion to have a communication made to Madame Teresa Ceracchi at Rome, & no correspondent there, I take the liberty of asking leave to do it through you. she is the widow of Ceracchi the Sculptor from Rome who lived sometime in Vienna, came over to Philadelphia, returned to Paris, there engaged in a conspiracy against the first Consul & was executed. his wife & family returned to Rome from whence I have recievedtwo letterspainting her distresses & praying relief from Congress. she says in these that Ceracchi had been charged with the execution of a national monument to perpetuate the foundation of our republic, that he had made all his models in terra cotta, that this work was suspended, & he not paid for his labours, and she prays an indemnity from Congress. she is entirely mistaken in the facts, which were strictly as follows. Ceracchi came over to Philadelphia of his own accord, bringing letters of introduction from the Van Staphorsts of Amsterdam. his first request was that General Washington would permit him to take his bust. Genl. Washington having been fatigued by numerous applications from painters to sit for their drawing, into a determination never to sit again, it was with great difficulty he could be prevailed on to yield to Ceracchi’s request. he did so at length, & an excellent bust was made of clay. he then employed himself at his lodgings in forming the model of a monument in honor of General Washington which he proposed to be employed by Congress to erect. it was a work of great genius, but so enormously beyond our habits of employing publicmoney, that he was advised at once not to expect it, by those who best knew the American way of thinking on matters of expence. he persevered however in solliciting the members. by way of disposing them favorably he asked leave to take the busts of many of them in clay & did so. it is not improbable that some of these gentlemen from mere good nature, may have avoided damping his hopes of inducing Congress to engage him in the work, but there were others who constantly & carefully warned him against the delusion. but not being able to persuade himself of the truth he brought over his family. this involved him in deep expence. his finances began to fail and [his?] hopes. despair drove him almost to insanity. he quitted the country abruptly[in]the highest disgust, leaving debts to a considerable amount, and giving his creditors orders on 4. or 5. particular individuals whose busts or medallions he had[made]in marble or Alabaster, and had sent to them unsolicited as presents. paiments however were made for these to his creditors: and so ended his visit[to this]country. nothing like an engagement, nor nothing like an intention to employ him ever was entered into by any public authority: and under these circumstances it is impossible that Congress should make any allowance.[th]is is the true state of facts. it is proper she should understand it, that she may not be kept under ill-founded hopes. it is not proper for me however[to]engage in this correspondence; & I have therefore thought I might ask of you[to]write to her, and to say that the above is known here to be a true statement[of]facts, & that therefore your government cannot think themselves justifiable[in]granting her the relief she desires.\nI think Ceracchi took as many as 20. busts of members, but most of them[. . .]obscure. whether he destroyed them when he got angry, I do not know. it is[hardly]probable he took the trouble of carrying or sending them to Rome. if he did, they[. . .]be of no value to his family, as the names are unknown there, and perhaps it might[. . .]some relief to them to convert them into money at some price. I learn that a bust[in]plaister is taken at Rome for about 1½ or 2 guineas. if the converting them into money at that price would be a relief to them, I would take the busts, & give [them] the money. yet I would not have them purchased in my name lest [the] family should mistake my motive. perhaps you may have some acquaintance in Rome who could enquire first whether such busts exist, and next whether they can be bought for that price. I know they have the bust in clay of Genl. Washington. I should be willing to give 10. or 15 guineas for that, which is 6. or 8[times]the price at Rome.\nSupposing that you are connected in commerce with some house in America to whom paiment could be made for you for the preceding object or[. . .]other, I would ask the favor of you, if that be the case, to send me one or two gross of the best Florence wine. I think the Montepulciano is generally deemed the best. if addressed to any port from New York to Norfolk inclusive, to the care of the collector of the customs of the place, it will be forwarded safely to me; and I imagine there must be vessels coming sometimes from Florence to that part of the United States. I am not much acquainted with the Montepulciano, (which is meant here by the term of Florence wine;) but I know it is not a sweet wine. these (sweet wines) you know are not esteemed in America.\nMr.Leartook leave yesterday, on his departure for Boston, where he goes in the Constitution frigate, bound to the Mediterranean, asConsul generalat Algiers, in place of mr Obrien who has resigned. the Philadelphia will also sail in a few days for the same destination, and will be followed by two or three 16. gun vessels.

In my No. 269. of the 24th of March last, I gave an ample statement of this Case, together with my correspondence which had passed upon it with the first Minister of State of H. C. M. As this was transmitted by more than one conveyance (as all my Dispatches have been) I doubt not some of the copies must have reached the Department at present under your direction, altho’ the receipt has never been acknowledged. A recurrence to the arguments made use of in my correspondence will demonstrate with how little reason a twentieth part of the value of the Ship & Cargo, has been adjudged to the Recaptors. They, however, not satisfied, have applied for a revision. It is as yet uncertain whether this will be admitted. Captn. Post is decidedly of opinion that, but for my interference, the condemnation of the whole property would have been definitively confirmed.\nThe Captn. of a small French vessel, who has put into Sn Andar on account of the damage he received in a gale of wind, reports that he sailed with the great expedition from Brest for St Domingo, on the 13th of this month. The fleet, according to his relation, has 25,000 troops on board: and there are five Spanish Line of Battle Ships in it.

Is “much harrassed with the complaints and sufferings” of American seamen; twenty are in the hospital and “at least one hundred and fifty strolling about the streets of this City in the greatest distress.” Some have been discharged from ships sold locally; but most have congregated at Bordeaux from other French ports and from Spain, “and they conduct [themselves] in general in so unruly a manner” that police have objected. Transcribes translation of 15 Jan. letter from police commissioner complaining about the conduct of the “vagabonds” and offering to cooperate with Lee in hastening their departure. Since receiving the letter, Lee has succeeded in having most of these “idle sailors” distributed among American vessels in port for return to U.S. European ports are “full of this valuable class of our Citizens.” Suggests that allowing a naval vessel in Mediterranean to carry them all home would be cheaper than present method of relief. Believes laws for protection of seamen should prevent captains from discharging crew in foreign ports for any reason, as they now use cruelty to force seamen to request discharge. If captains of vessels sold abroad had to provide passage and support for seamen until they arrived home, it would stop such abuse and prevent U.S. seamen from “entering into foreign service to the prejudice of the Commerce of the United States.”\nComplains that he has no authority to prevent a widespread fraud practiced by foreign, particularly French, merchants in America who purchase damaged tobacco, cotton, and rice, insure the goods heavily, and ship them to France, where well-paid local inspectors declare cargo has arrived in poor condition. Goods are disposed of at public sale for low prices, and American insurers must pay the balance. Not only does this “nefarious practice” cheat U.S. companies, but “the sale of this trash” will lower reputation of American goods.

    "content": "WashingtonJany. 19th 1810\nDear Sir\nI have received your favour of the 10th. Your anxiety that our country may be kept out of the vortex of war, is honourable to your judgment as a patriot, and to your feeling as a man. The same anxiety is, I sincerely believe, felt by the great body of the nation, & by its public councils; most assuredly by the Executive Branch of them. But the question may be decided for us, by actual hostilities against us, or by proceedings, leaving no choice but between absolute disgrace & resistance by force. May not also manifestations of patience under injuries & indignities, be carried so far, as to invite this very dilemma?\nI devoutly wish that the same disposition to cultivate peace by means of justice which exists here, predominated elsewhere, particularly in G. B. But how can this be supposed, whilst she persists in proceedings, which comprise the essence of hostility; whilst she violates towards us rules, which she enforces against us in her own favour; more particularly whilst we see her converting the late reconciliation through one of her Ministers, into a source of fresh difficulties & animosities, thro’ another: For in this light must be viewed, her disavowal of Mr. Erskine, and the impressions made thro’ his successor. Had the disavowal been deemed essential to her interests, a worse plaister could not have been devised for the wound necessarily inflicted here. But was the disavowal essential to her interests? was it material to them; taking for the test, her own spontaneous change of system, & her own official language? By the former I refur [sic] to her orders of April, restricting their original orders against neutrals, to a trade with France and Holland: by the latter, to the conversation of Mr. Canning with Mr. P., in which he abandons, as he could not but do, two of the conditions which had been contemplated; and admits that a non-intercourse law here against Holland was not a sine qua non; So that the arrangement of Mr. E. was disavowed essentially for want ofa pledge that our non-intercourse would be continued against France & her dominions. But why disavow absolutely, why at all, on this account? The law was known to be in force against France at the time of the arrangement. It was morally certain that if put in force against France whilst she was pleading the British orders, it would not be withdrawn, if she should persist in her decrees, after being deprived of this plea. And there could be no fair ground to suppose, that the condition would not be pledged & stipulated, if required, as soon as the requisite Authorities here should be together. The disavowal is the more extraordinary, as the arrangement was to be respected till the 20th. of July, and therefore with the addition of four or five weeks only, would have afforded an opportunity of knowing the sense of this Govt. and of supplying all that was wanted to satisfy the British Ultimatum. This course was so obvious, & that pursued so opposite, that we are compelled to look to other motives for an explanation, & to include among these, a disinclination to put an end to differences from which such advantages are extracted by British Commerce & British Cruisers.\nNotwithstanding all these grounds of discontent & discouragement, we are ready, as the B. Govt. knows, to join in any new experiment, (& thro’ either our diplomatic channel there, or hers here) for a cordial & comprehensive adjustment of matters between the two countries.\nLet reparation be made for the acknowledged wrong commited in the case of the Chesapeak, a reparation so cheap to the wrongdoer, yet so material to the honour of the injured party; & let the orders in Council, already repealed as to the avowed object of retaliation, be repealed also as an expedient for substituting an illicit commerce, in place of that to which neutrals have, as such, an incontestible right. The way will then be opened for negotiation at large; and if the B. Govt. would bring into it the same temper as she would find in us; & the same disposition to insist on nothing inconsistent with the rule of doing as she would, or rather as shewillbe done by, the result could not fail to be happy for both.\nPermit me to remark that you are under a mistake in supposing that the Treaty concluded by Messr. M. & P. was rejected because it did not provide that free ships should make free goods. It never was required nor expected that such a stipulation should be inserted. As to deserting Seamen, you will find that G. B. practices against us the principles we assert against her, and in fact goes further; that we have always been ready to enter into a convention on that subject founded on reciprocity; and that the documents long since in print show, that we are willing, on the subject of impressment, to put an end to it, by an arrangement, which most certainly would be better for the British Navy, than that offensive resource, & which might be so managed as to leave both parties at liberty to retaintheir own ideas of right. Let me add that the acceptance of that Treaty would have very little changed the actual situation of things with G. B. The Orders in Council would not have been prevented but rather placed on stronger ground; the case of the Chesapeak, the same as it is; so also the case of impressments, of fa[c]titious blockades &c all as at present, pregnant sources of contention & ill-humour.\nFrom this view of the subject, I cannot but persuade myself, that you will concur in opinion, that if unfortunately, the calamity you so benevolently dread, should visit this hitherto favoured Country, the fault will not lie where you would wish it not to lie. Accept assurances of my esteem & friendship\nJames Madison\nJany. 19. P. S. Since I recd. your letter of the 10. and whilst the above was undergoing a copy, yours of the 14th. has come to hand, informing me of your intention to embark in about 8 days for England; an intention I presume suddenly formed as it is not alluded to in your first letter. The Secretary of State will avail himself of your polite offer to take charge of communications to our Minister in London; tho’ I fear that your departure may take place before he can be in readiness. I shall myself ask the favor of your attention to a private letter to him, which I shall forward by tomorrow’s Mail."

I believe we are under half a dozen at present; I mean the signers of the Declaration. yourself, Gerry, Carroll, and myself are all I know to be living. I am the only one South of the Patomac. is Robert TreatPayne, orFloydliving? it is long since I heard of them, and yet I do not recollect to have heard of their deaths.\nMoreton’s deduction of the origin of our Indians from the fugitive Trojans, stated inyour letter of Jan. 26.and his manner of accounting for the sprinckling of their Latin with Greek, is really amusing.Adairmakes them talk Hebrew.Reinold Fosterderives them from the soldiers sent by Kouli Khan to conquer Japan.Berewoodfrom the Tartars, as well as our bears, wolves, foxes Etc. which he says ‘must of necessity fetch their beginning from Noah’s ark, which rested, after the deluge, in Asia, seeing they could not proceed by the course of nature, as the unperfect sort of living creatures do, from putrefaction.’Bernard Romansis of opinion that God created an original man & woman in this part of the globe. DoctrBartonthinks they are not specifically different from thePersians; but, taking afterwards a broader range, he thinks ‘that in all the vast countries of America, there is but one language, nay that it may be proven, or rendered highly probable, that all the languages of the earth bear some affinity together.’ this reduces it to a question of definition, in which every one is free to use his own. to wit, what constitutes identity, or difference in two things? (in the common acceptation ofsameness.) all languages may be called the same, as being all made up of the same primitive sounds, expressed by the letters of the different alphabets. but, in this sense, all things on earth are the same, as consisting of matter. this gives up the useful distribution into genera & species, which we form, arbitrarily indeed, for the relief of our imperfect memories. to aid the question, from whence are our Indian tribesdescended? some have gone into their religion, their morals, their manners, customs, habits, and physical forms. by such helps it may be learnedly proved that our trees and plants of every kind are descended from those of Europe; because, like them they have no locomotion, they draw nourishment from the earth, they clothe themselves with leaves in spring, of which they divest themselves in autumn for the sleep of winter Etc. our animals too must be descended from those of Europe, because our wolves eat lambs, our deer are gregarious, our ants hoard Etc. but when, for convenience, we distribute languages, according to common understanding, into Classes originally different, as we chuse to consider them, as the Hebrew, the Greek, the Celtic, the Gothic; and these again into genera, or families, as the Icelandic, German, Swedish, Danish, English; and these last into species, or dialects, as English, Scotch, Irish, we then ascribe other meanings to the terms ‘same’ and ‘different.’ in some one of these senses, Barton, and Adair, and Foster, and Brerewood, & Moreton, may be right, every one according to his own definition of what constitutes ‘identity.’ Romans indeed takes a higher stand, and supposes a separate creation. on the same unscriptural ground, he had but to mount one step higher, to suppose no creation at all, but that all thingshaveexisted without beginning in time, as they now exist, and may for ever exist, producing and reproducing in a circle, without end. this would very summarily dispose of mr Morton’s learning, and shew that the question of Indian origin, like many others pushed to a certain height, must recieve the same answer, ‘Ignoro.’\nYou ask if the usage of hunting in circles has ever been known among any of our tribes of Indians? it has been practised by them all; and is to this day, by those still remote from the settlements of the whites. but their numbers not enabling them, like Genghis Kahn’s 700,000. to form themselves into circles of 100. miles diameter, they make their circle by firing the leaves fallen on the ground, which gradually forcing the animals to a center, they there slaughter them with arrows, darts and other missiles. this is called firehunting, and has been practised in this state within my time by the white inhabitants. this is the most probable cause of the origin & extension of the vast prairies in the Western country, where the grass having been of extraordinary luxuriance, has made a conflagration sufficient to kill even the old, as well as the young timber.\nI sincerely congratulate you on the successes of our little navy; which must be more gratifying to you than to most men, as having been the early and constant advocate of wooden walls. if I havediffered with you on this ground, it was not on the principle, but the time, supposing that we cannot build or maintain a navy, which will not immediately fall into the same gulph which has swallowed, not only the minor navies, but even those of the great second rate powers of the sea. whenever these can be resuscitated, and brought so near to a balance with England that we can turn the scale, then is my epoch for aiming at a navy. in the mean time one competent to keep the Barbary states in order, is necessary; these being the only smaller powers disposed to quarrel with us. but I respect too much the weighty opinions of others to be unyielding on this point, and acquiesce with the prayer ‘quod felix faustumque sit,’adding ever a sincere one for your health and happiness.\nTh: Jefferson"

You will observe a difference in the Form of the Acorns, those of an oval Figure are from the Live-Oak Tree, an ever-green much esteemed for Ship-building & the delightful Shade it affords: those which are nearly round are from a Tree called the Water-Oak, which altho’not an ever-green, is tall & majestick in appearance. I don’t recollect having observ’d any of the same species to the Northward of this State. I have not sent you so many of the Live-Oak Acorns as I cou’d have wish’d, there were near a Peck collected, but I had the mortification to find that most of them were destroy’d by the Rats. In order however to repair the loss in some measure I have sent you a box containing twenty odd of the Plants which have been growing in it ever since they were placed there by the hands of Major Washington. In the ⟨closed⟩-Box you will find a paper containing some seeds of the Laurel-Tree which are all that I could procure; the Birds are so fond of them that it is a difficult matter to get them fully ripe. The Laurel-Tree is an evergreen, grows very tall & bears a large Beautiful Flower very fragrant in its smell. In the Box containing the Live-Oak Plants I have inserted upwards of twenty of the sweet-scented Shrub, which bears an odoriferous Flower. It will allways give me pleasure to execute any commands you may have in this country.

I trust that this is not the case, or that the loss was not extensive. My informant, who had only heard of the circumstance accidentally, mentions nothing of the particulars.\nHerewith I have sent the letter of MrBarlow which I mentioned to you: & the sketch proposed for fitting up one of the Elliptical Rooms in the Rotunda as a Lecture Room for Messrs Key & Long, & myself.\nI am not aware of any place where the instruments which are now upon the road can be deposited. My own house is now as full of apparatus connected with my department, as it can be without materially interfering with the other purposes for which it was designed.\nShould the instruments be placed at any distance from the room where I lecture, the bringing them backward & forward exposes them to a great chance of being damaged: &, on this account, if the room which you assigned us cannot be immediately fitted up, perhaps one of the Dormitories adjoining my pavillion would be the most eligible place for their reception.\nDrEmmet, who, from his lectures being nearly of the same nature as mine, met with difficulties similar to those which I formerly mentioned to you, has now three of the four elliptical rooms in the Rotunda; one of these, that which is set apart for a museum, is at present made no use of; & the Proctor has suggested that if this were fitted up in the manner described in the sketch, the benches & tables would be readily shifted into the opposite room when it was ready for their reception.\nC: Bonnycastle"

(Your Excellency observing very rightly the danger of carrying any artillery there at all.) I am of opinion we Should interrupt and retard their Works and Strike a Blow there—if it can be done with any prospect of Success. to effect this, a Body of Troops ought to [be] kept constantly as near them as may be consistent with their Safety, to observe the Enemy, defend the Entrance of the Clove & Such Passages as lead into it, for if the Enemies Should once have penetrated into the Mountains the chance would become equal on both Sides, instead of keeping them off the advantage of the Ground must remain on our Side, & this to be continued whilst our army is employed in finishing the Works at West point.

I suppose your Father has written to you. he is vex’d with the Printer for Publishing in three Numbers what ought all to have been in one. he says the writer of Columbus had better publish in a pamphlet by which a printer may get money, and as pamphlets are much in vogue at present. suppose you should hint it to him your Father sends his thanks to the writer, for his masterly defence of the writers upon the Law of Nature and Nations and for laying before the publick such passages as are extreemly to the purpose Genet made him a visit as he did to other Senators who allhastnedto return it. he was at home when your Father returnd his. there conversation was confind to inquiries after his mother & sisters, &c and to some discussion about the form of their New constitution. Take Genets Character from one who has long been accustomed “to look quite through the deeds of Men” [“]He appears a youth totally destitute of all experience in popular Governments popular assemblies or conventions of any kind: very little accustomed to reflect on his own or his fellow creatures Hearts wholy ignorant of the Law of Nature & Nations, the civil Law and even of the dispatches of Ancient Ambassadors with which his own Nation and Language abounds A declamatory stile a flitting fluttering Imagination an Ardour in his Temper, and a civil deportment are all the accomplishments or qualifications to be found in him for his place” and this Character I would send to the Printer if Idared. you may if you will venture. it is the most favourable one that is due to him. mr Jefferson treats him I think quite as freely as Columbus Have the Libel which was printed upon the President by Greenleaf & the Resolves which past at the Coffe house in concequence of it, reachd Boston. your Father mentions it in one of his Letters. the P—— finds that there is more than one Church left in America. I dont know where he could find ports enough to make them all into Consuls— I own that is a little spightfull, yet I do Revere respect honour and Love the President.—\nI shall send next saturday for you. if you have an opportunity to send to Charles the remaining Numbers do. the Tigers paw will delight him. I felt the down of it when I read it. I do not mean however to single out this beautifull metaphor as the only object worth consideration I have read all the Numbers with attention and consider them a valuable present to the publick tending, to place in a true and just point of view the conduct of a Man who has disgraced his office, and made himself so obnoxious as scarcly to be entitled to common decency. partizans may Rail, but sound reason will enlighten and prevail. I see a scene opening before me which will call for as great exertions from the rising generation as their Fathers have already pasd through. may all those to whom talants and abilities are entrusted qualify themselves for the Guidence and protection of the common Weal. Parties are arising and forming themselves upon Principals altogether Repugnant to the good order and happiness of society. No fire, says an Author I have lately been reading assails a civil edifice so voilently as the Flame of National Passion, for it consumes the very stones of the Fabrick levels merrit to the Ground and makes reason tremble excites tumults and insults and makes way for the triumphant entry of Ambition those Hearts which ought to be cordially united by the Bonds of Brotherly Love Breathe nothing but vengance & Rancour\nadieu yours affectionatly\nA Adams"

    "content": "Philadelphia July 18th: 1812\nMy dear friend,\nDuring the revolutionary War I kept notes and preserved pamphlets with a view to write memoirs of it. From the immense difference in my facts and opinions from those that were current and popular, I was sure if I had published them they would not have been believed, and would moreover have exposed me & my posterity to persecution. I therefore burnt all my notes (the characters of the gentlemen who subscribed the declaration of Independance excepted) and gave my pamphlets to my son Richard who was carried <to> them with him to Washington. This I hope will be a sufficient reason for my not <[. . .]> being one of the judges of the histories you have wished to have written. But my friend, why blot paper with any more records of the folly and wickedness of man?—Were I compelled to write a history of any <race of beings> of the human race it should be of my lunatic patients in the hospital. There I should findfollyonly, for most of them are innocent and some of them amiable. There is not a <party man> french Jacobin, nor a visionary democrat, not an Essex Juneto man, nor a priest deranged with federalism, <nor> or democracy, nor a governor compounding praying & fasting <and> with party politicks, among them all.\nWars I believe are not only <[. . .]> inevitable and necessary, but sometimesobligatoryupon nations. “Nil Dei mortalibus ”—sine (not only labore) but “sine bello.” We rise in society & we preserve our property”, our names, & our <or> standing in it, nay more, our lives by means of War. The Weapons employed in this War are law Suits, doors and locks and bolts. To neglect to employ these weapons is to forfeit those blessings. Nations in like manner can exist <on> with all the proragatives of nations only by War. It is the condition by which they navigate the ocean, and preserve their territory from incursion. To neglect to contend for both by arms, is to forfeit <our> their right to them. The Ocean has been called the high road of nations. It might be called Gods gift to all nations. Not to maintain the <[. . .]> exercise and enjoyment of this gift—is (I hope I do not say too much when I add) <[. . .]> ingratitude, and disobedience to Him that gave it.To expectperpetual peace therefore among beings constituted as we are, is as absurd as to expect to discover perpetual motion. I have read no other state paper upon the Subject of our war but Mr Madison’s message to Congress recommending a declaration of War, but from my knowledge of the authors & Subscribers of the addresses you allude to, I am prepared to believe all you say of them. Some of them, or of thier leaders I know cursed Mr Jefferson some years ago for his cowardice for not doing exactly what Mr: Madison has done.\nI blush for the selfishness, ignorance and party Spirit of our Citizens, and in thinking of them, have often applied to them the words of Jugurtha that you have quoted <to them> in your letter. <[. . .]> Is our nationwortha War? Would it not have been more correct, and more in unison with our habits, & principles, had Congress instead of declaring War sent an Advertisement to be published in all the <nations> news papers in Europe drawn up in some such form as the following?\n“For Sale\nto the highest bidder.\nThe United States of America.\nTerms of payment.—A bank in every village in the Country composed of five houses, and a dozen in every city;—commerce with the whole world; a whiskey distillery on every farm—& <the> a Charter conveying to the whole nation and to every individual in it, the title of‘disciples of Washington.’ Enquire of messrs: ——— in Boston and of messrs: ——— in New York and Philada.”\nI lament with you the manner in which our Rulers have begun the War. But,—but my friend. Non est “fas mihi audita loqui.” There are empires in all professions as well as in medicine. The world will not bear principles inpracticalSciences. In seeking the “faults” you allude to, I have made enemies, or Scoffers of all my medical brethren.—\nYou are mistaken in supposing that I think our executive too strong. I wish it were wholly independant of the Senate in all its appointments. I wish further, that the President should be chosen for 7. 9. or 11 years, and afterwards become ineligible to that or any <off> other Station or Office, with a salery of 2, or 3 thousand dollars a year to compensate for that disability, & to enable him to support the expenses to which his having filled the office of President would expose him in subsequent life. This would give him an independance as <in public life> the first magistrate of the nation that would obviate one half the evils of our Government.—\nAdeiu! From Dear Sir / ever yours\nBenjn: Rush.\nPS: I permitted miss Lyman to read one of your late letters to me. She accorded with all your opinions, and was delighted with the force & brilliancy of your stile. <Of> When She returned it, She said “this gentleman is too great an Object to be fully seen and known while heis so near us. Such minds require the distance of centuries to be perfectly understood, and fully appreciated.”\nJuly 20. I have just seen my Son’s Oration. I fear it contains too many indigestible and inebriating truths for the weak stomachs and heads ofmostof our citizens.—He informs me that he intended to send you a copy of it. Our old friend Saml Adams used to say “Nations were as free as they deserved to be” and that “even enslaved Nations were free when they preferred slavery to liberty, <for> inasmuch as freedom consisted in possessing the Objects of our predilection.”—Alas! for what have You thought, and read, and wrote and Spoke, and negociated? They have taken away my Gods—<What have we> They have taken away the profits of our banks, and whiskey distilleries, and reduced the price of our grain—What! What! have we left?—yes—<they have> the last has been taken away for atimeonly, that you may enjoy a high price for it for ever. Happily would it be for our country if the <[. . .]> two former <if they> were taken away for ever."

    "content": "Paris28 August 1804\nSir\nI yesterday received your letter of 26th of June announcing the appointment of Genl Armstrong as my Successor, & covering a letter of leave to theFirst Consul. Notwithstanding my wish to go at an earlier period, I found it impossible in then [sic] State of our affairs, as I knew no person with whom I could leave the charge. I had hoped to have prevailed on Mr Graham, but he refused to accept it. As I had daily the hopes of bringing the business of the debts to a close, I thought I could not Justify leaving the creditors who were in expectation of being paid a longer time unsatisfied, & I hoped by my return from England to have been honoured by your final instructions. Before I can now pack up & remove my family to Nantz or Bordeaux, & find a Ship for their accommodation the Season will be too far advanced not to apprehend a long passage & an unpleasant weather upon our coast—this determines me together with the circumstances I shall mention to remain till my place is Supplied by the arrival of Genl Armstrong who must now be expected every day after which I shall make a tour into Italy & come out in the Spring. If during my stay in Europe I can be of any use to the President, to you or to the Governt I shall think myself honoured by your commands: I am Sorry I can make no use of the letter of leave, as it was not known to you, at the time that it was written that the Government has assumed a new form. Indeed I could use no letter unless accompanied with a Commission So that my Situation will be very awkward in going. I presume before the departure of Genl Armstrong the changes will be known as he will not otherwise be enabled to act even informally & as those Ministers who were before accredited now do. I have received no late letters from Spain, but I found matters have been carried very far there, & that Mr Pinkney has been, or Still is on the eve of departing: I have therefore thought it necessary to press the business in Several conferences I have had with the Minister within the few days that have passed Since his return, I have also Spoken very Seriously on the Subject to admiral Gravina the Spanish ambassador who tells me that instructions are gone to the United States on the Subject: But as I find that the French Ministers appeared to favour the Spanish construction of the Treaty & theEmperor was absent, I thought it best to assure them that the President would allow of no delay in the execution of the Treaty or of any other construction than the one we put upon it, & to do this in such form as [to] Shew that we had the means of doing ourselves justice.\nI enclose the note I have Sent in to the Minister on the Subject. I strongly suspect that Gravina has not failed to use the means I suggested to you since one of the confidential persons of- - - - - has been twice with me to advise that we Should not press this to extremities, but leave time for negotiating &c. I told him that being Sure of our right, I presumed that the President would do as all other Statesmen did on Similar occasions he would keep his object in view & press towards it when circumstances best favoured its attainment, that he might himself judge, whether if, (as he intimated) France made common cause with Spain contrary to the express letter of her Treaty, he would think it more prudent to wait till peace, or to avail himself of the advantages that war afforded; that I did not mean to Say that no accommodation for the mutual advantage of both countries would not be attended to; that on the contrary I believed that Some arrangements might be made by purchase, or by exchanges on the Western boundary of Louisiana against East Florida, which would be very advantageous to Spain, but that I had no instruction to interfere in this business which was entrusted to other hands—except So far as to demand from France the execution of the Treaty She had entered into with us for which we had paid a faithful consideration—That he must easily See that we never could consent after having purchased as we believed the whole of the Mississipi, that Spain Should retain a considerable territory on one of its banks & thus be enabled to elude all our revenue laws.\nThe Minister goes to day to Aix-la-chapelle to meet the Emperor & will be absent Some time: So that till the return of the Court here, I do not expect that any thing will be done. I shall press this business as much as possible with Mr Hauterive who has considerable weight in American affairs.\nI have the honor to transmit you also my notes relative to the treatment our vessels receive in the Islands, the other object upon which I have been favoured by your instructions—the Minister of the Marine has been absent almost ever Since I received the President’s orders on this Subject, or I think I should have been able before this to have brought the business to a Satisfactory close. Mr Talleyrand has promised to press it when he Sees the Emperor. The moment has been So critical that it is difficult to draw the attention of the Emperor to these lesser objects. I wrote you of the demand of Russia & the probability of a war if, (as I knew they would be not) his demands were not complyed with & the delay of Austria in Sending new credentials as well as in renewing the note at the Diet, looked extremely like a disposition on her part to take a part in the new coalition that England was endeavouring to form: I believe however that the thing willpass over. The Russian chargé d’affaires is Still here, he has received no answer. This Court deeming it prudent to give the Emperor of Russia time to cool. You will find by the papers enclosed that the Emperor of Germany has declared himself hereditary Emperor of Austria &c that he quotes in Support of this measure, not only the Example of Russia, but ofFrance: This together with his having Sent the new letter of ⟨credit⟩ makes it probable that he means to remain at peace. It is understood that the Plan of making a king of Lombardy is Sacrificed to this object. I think therefore that upon the whole England will Still have to contend Single handed unless She can bring Sweeden to take a part, whose king has Shewn great inveteracy to France, & been treated very Severely in return. He is Still riding post thro’ Germany & neglecting his own kingdom.\nI have yet received no answer to my note on the Subject of the debt: this has arisen from two causes. 1st the absence of the Emperor & Ministers, next their wish to know how far the 20,000,000 will comprize the whole of them, as they are very fearful of being charged beyond that. There is no doubt from the Strict manner in which they examine the accounts that if the debts are confined to the words of the Convention, to wit: to all that had been presented prior to its date, that it will not amount to 16 millions, & I very much believe, that even including So much of what has Since been presented which can be proved that it will not exceed the 20,000,000. As the Bureaux are going on very rapidly, I hope that I Shall know before it is necessary to draw any bills. If Genl Armstrong Sailed by the first of this month, I hope as the winds have been very favourable to have the pleasure of seeing him in a few days, when I Shall Surrender the business into his hands & give him all the aid in my power on his entering upon it. I have the honor to be Sir With the most respectful attachment Your most Obt hum: Servt\nRobt R Livingston"

They have been pleased to direct that you communicate it to his britannic Majesty—that You inform him that the Complaint stated in it, being in general Terms and unsupported by any particular Facts or Evidence, they do not think it necessary or proper to take any Measures in Consequence of it—And that you assure him, that as it is their Determination the Treaty of Peace shall be punctually observed by their Citizens, and that his Majesty’s Subjects shall enjoy here, all the Rights which friendly & civilized Nations claim from each other; so they will always be ready to hear every Complaintwhich may appear to be well founded, and to redress such of them as on Investigation shall prove to be so.—\nThis Communication will give you an Opportunity of remarking, that the Office of Consul General does not extend to Matters of this Kind, neither the Rights of Commerce nor of Navigation being in Question, and therefore that it was Delicacy towards his Majestyand not^rather than^a Sense of the Propriety of such an Application from a Consul General, which induced Congress to treat it with this Mark of Attention.—\nIt would perhaps be well to pursue the Subject, to intimate the Expediency as well as Propriety of sending a Minister here, and if Circumstances should so dictate, to accompany it with Assurances that Congress expect a Minister and are ready to receive and treat him in a Manner consistent with the Respect due to his Sovereign.—\nThe Advantage alluded to in one of your Letters, if no other, would result from such an Appointment Vizt.—That the british Court would then probably receive more accurate Representations of Affairs in this Country, than they are at present supplied with by Men, who write and speak more as their Wishes and Feelings than as Truth and Knowledge dictate.—I have the Honor to be &c.\nThe Honorable John Adams Esquire—\nYour Secretary is further of Opinion that he should write the following Answer to Mr. Temple’s Letter Vizt.\nSir\nI took the earliest Opportunity after the Meeting of Congress to lay your Letter of 21st.December before them.—\nThey have ordered a Copy of it to be transmitted to their Minister at the Court of London with Directions to communicate it to his britannic Majesty—to inform him that, the Complaint stated in it being in general Terms and unsupported by any particular Facts or Evidence, they do not think it necessary or proper to take any Measures in Consequence of it: And to assure him, that as it is their Determination the Treaty of Peace shall be punctually observed by their Citizens, and that his Majesty’s Subjects shall here enjoy all the Rights which friendly and civilized Nations claim from each other, so they will always be ready to hear every Complaint which may appear to be well founded, and to redress such as on Investigation shall prove to be so.— I have the Honor to be &c:\nJohn Temple Esqr.

This covers a Bond Executed by me for the performance of the Consular Functions.\nThe uncertainty of the Intercourse with America from this Country during the War, will deprive me of writing to you as often as I shou’d otherwise do—and the little respect English Privateers shew to letters, requires Circumspection in all remarks from hence.\nThe Neutrality of America, and her Flagg has been generally respected by all the Belligerent Powers in Europe, tho’ their Cruizers commit many depredations, as You will see by the Protests and Judgement herewith sent: and I must observe that, altho’ the French commit many Errors in deciding on the Validity of Vessels Papers on the High Seas, they respect infinitely more, the Rights of Men, and Nations, preserve decency, and moderation in their proceedings, respect the Sanctity of letters and Seals, and are more ready and disposed to do Justice, and repair Injuries than the English or Spaniards, particularly the English Cruizers, who have in many instances added insult to Injustice, as you will See by the Papers inclosed. The Brig Sally Captain Storch of Salem, bound from Havre to Bordeaux and Alexandria, was taken and brought in here by a French Armed Vessel. The Court of Admiralty on the verification of her Papers and my application, immediately restor’dto the Captain the Vessel and Cargo, free of Injury and Costs. I inclose you the Judgement.\nAnother Brig from Same place, the Nancy Captain Barker has been carried into Bayonne, and I have reason to expect equal Justice will be Shewn her. The National Convention decreed the 9th. May, that their Armed Ships might Stop all Neutral Vessels bound to an Enemys Port, and take out any part of their Cargoes that was not Neutral Property. On immediate Representations made to them, they excepted the American Flag the 23d: of same month.\nThe Political Situation of this Country appears precarious—the most wise cannot See how things will end.

As a matter of opinion I take the liberty of observing to you, that if a delay in some Stage of the remittances cannot be avoided, it had better be between the second and third than between the first and second, and that, from the natural Influence which early credit gains—\nI am informed that there is a farther arrival of supplies from Paris, on the Continental Account and that part of our Howitzrs are expected from Nantz— if the latter arrives in time we shall embark them— The Remainder will arrive in the course of the next month, and as they are a very important object, they will furnish an additional Motive for hastening the second Convoy.\nMr. Jackson has transmitted me as yet nothing more than the Invoice of the Cargo which Capt. Gillon had laden on board the Indian on account of the state of south Carolina— The Articles in general coincide in general with our present demands, those which do not, are rejected— As soon as I was apprised of the ample supply of blue Cloth by the Marquis De la Fayette, I wrote to stop the purchases of that Article in holland— I have not as yet heard of Mr. Gillon’s arrival at Amsterdam, nor has he written to me. Neither am I acquainted with the reasons of his delay.\nYou will receive a letter of mine to congress under cover of Mr. Moylan’s which please to distroy. I have changed my mindas to the propriety of sending it, and it being out of my hands I have taken this as the securest method of extinguishing it—\nAs my father from the Circumstances of his Captivity, added to the Misfortune of having his possessions in the hands of the Enemy must necessarily be in the wants of money, I request your Excellency to furnish him from the public funds of which I shall inform Congress, he has hitherto been supplied by his friend Mr. Manning, but private resources, in time of War, especially in the undefined mode of the present one, are very precarious— It is with pleasure I renew my best wishes, and the assurances of veneration and attachment with which I have the honor to be Your Excellencys most obedient servant\nJohn Laurens.\nP.S.You will please to seal or not the enclosed, as the Circumstance of Conveyance may make most Convenient.\nHis Excellency Benjamin Franklin Esqr"

I see little probability, on the whole of any final agreement, particularly thro’ Mr B. who probably has not & will not receive definitive authority. The best course therefore seems to be, to send some such plan as mentioned in my former letter, to Mr. Adams, with definitive powers to agree to it, or to as much of it as can be attained, and to work a formal arrangement.\nThe information from Mr. Prentiss, may furnish topics for conversation with Mr. Bagot, & communication to Mr Adams. It forbids the hope of any arrangement with the former, if the proposition held out by him be any thing like a measure of his powers.\nThe name to the other letter now returned, which puzzled you is Sam: L.

You may express to him the esteem known to be entertained by me, for his learning & talents, and the confidence also entertained in his zeal for patriotic objects, that we are sensible of the merits of those suggested by him, but it does not appear that any distinct provision isauthorized for pursuing them in the mode suggested for availing the public, and the cause of science, of the Servic[e]s he tenders.

In the Absence of the Pope at Avignon, and the People having no regular Check upon the Nobles, these fell into their usual Dissentions, and oppressed the People till they were ripe to be duped by any single Enthusiast, bold Adventurer, ambitious Usurper, or hypocritical Villain who should, with sufficient Imprudence, promise them Justice, <Humanity> Clemency and Liberty. One or all of these Characters belonged to Rienzi, who was finally murdered by the People whom he had deceived, and who had deceived him.\nTacitus appears to have been as great an Enthusiast as Petrarch for the Revival of the Republic, and universal Empire. He has exerted the Vengeance of History upon the Emperors, but has veiled the Conspiracies against them, and the incorrigible Corruption of the People, which probably provoked their most atrocious Cruelties. Tyranny can scarcely be practiced upon a virtuous and wise People.\nMr. Whitcomb preached and dined with me."

Commrs. which I now inclose; and upon which I wish to be favour’d with Your Sentiments.\nWe thought ourselves unfortunate in being deprived of your, & my Friend the Attorney’s Assistance, in this important Business; and nothing but absolute Necessity shou’d have induced me to enter upon it, without You; but the Maryland Gentlemen wou’d have been much disgusted with a Disappoi[nt]ment, after attending, at such a Distance, in very bad Weather. We waited some Days expecting Your Arrival in Alexandria; when I received a Letter from the Attorney, upon other Business, without mentioning a Word of the Meeting, or of the Assembly’s Appointment: this co[n]vinced Us that there must have been some Blunder or Neglect, in some of the public Offices, in not giving the proper Notification to the Virga. Commrs. The Maryland Gentlemen declared that Nothing had been ommitted on their Part, that they had written an official Letter to the Virga. Comrs. (addressed by their Governor to the Co[mr]s of ours) proposing the Time & Place, if agreeable to them, and if not, desiring they wou’d name some other; that having recd. no Answer, they took it for granted, that the Time & Place was accepted, and attended accordingly.\nSo great has been the Neglect in some of our public Departments, that neither Mr. Henderson or myself had been furnished with Copys of the Assembly’s Resolutions; and I shou’d not have known that I was one of the Persons appointed, had I not, by mere Accident two or three Days before the Meeting, been informed of it, by two of the Maryland Commissioners writing to Me, that they shou’d endeavour to take my House in their Way, and go with Me to Alexandria. His Excellency General Washington happened to have a Copy of the Assembly’s Resolutions respecting the Application to be made to the Government of Pensylvania, which He very obligingly gave Us; by whichany twoor more of the Comrs. were impowered to proceed; and it was natural for Us to conclude that these last Resolutions had pursued the Style of the former respecting the Jurisdiction of the two States; as well as that this Subject had been taken up, upon the same Principles as in the Year1778; when Comrs. were directed to settle the Jurisdiction ofChesapeak Bay & the Rivers Potomack & Pokomoke; in which Sentiments, Mr. Henderson, from what He was able to recollect of the Resolutions, concurred.\nThus disagreeably circumstanced, only two of the Virga. Commission present, & without any Copy of the Resolves upon the Principal Subject, we thought it better to proceed, than to disappoint the Maryd. Commissioners; who appeard to have brought with them the most amicable Dispositions, and express’d the greatest Desire of forming such a fair & liberal Compact, as might prove a lasting Cement of Friendship between the two States; which we were convinced, it is their mutual Interest to cultivate: We therefore, upon the particular Invitation of the General, adjourn’d to Mount Vernon, and finished the Business there. Some Time after, Mr. Henderson wrote to Mr. Beckley (Clerk of the House of Delegates) for a Copy of the Resolves; upon receiving which, we were surprized to find no mention made ofChesapeakorPokomoke River, that our Powers were confined toPotomack River, and to not less thanthreeof the Commissioners. I am still inclined to think that the Ommission of Chesapeake Bay & Pokomoke River was owing to Mistake, or Inadvertence, in not attending to the Resolves of 1778; and if so, it was perhaps lucky, that we had not been furnished with a Copy of the Resolves; for the Maryd. Comrs. had an express Instruction, from their Assembly, to consider the Relinquishment, on the Part of Virginia, of any Claim of laying Tolls &c, on Vessels passing thro’ the Capes of Chesapeake, as a sine qua non; and if it was refused, immediately to break off all further Confurence with the Virginia Commissioners.\nThis blundering Business, however, will give Me the Trouble & Expence of a Journey to Richmond, next Session, to appologize for, & explain our Conduct; when, if the Substance of the Compact is approved by the Assembly, I hope Forms will be dispensed with; especially as the Breach of them has been the Fault of some of their own Officers, not ours; and as I am conscious of our having been influenced by no other Motives than the Desire of promoting the public Good."

    "content": "MonticelloMar. 30. 28.\nDear Sir\nI have to acknowledge your two favors of the 8th & 27th instant. The last came to hand yesterday evening, too late to be answered effectually (the papers being at the University) by this morning’s mail; and you will, in consequence, not receive the copy you desire, till wednesday: a delay from which I hope no inconvenience will result. For the account of the London University, which is an object of great interest with me, my thanks are due. It has not yet been handed over to me; when it is, I will take an early opportunity of sending it to Genl. Cocke.\nYou will probably be surprised to learn that I have engaged in the Charlottesville paper; and not much so, to be told that it was sorely against my inclinations. The circumstances———which the many kind evidences of interest for which I have to thank Mrs Madison & yourself, induce me to trouble you with a statement of, are shortly these: Mr Gilmer was anxious to retire; and from the arrangement originally made between himself & Mr Davis, the wishes of the latter were to be consulted as to the successor. This successor, I was repeatedly & urgently pressed by Mr D. to become. The inducement held out, was the profitableness of the property; which, under actual circumstances, would nett me between 5 and 600 dollars a year; and, at this rate, pay for itself in two years. This, in my present situation, was a strong argument. Considering the perhapsliterallyvital importance of my remaining under the same roof with Mrs R; I long ago made up my mind to do so, as long as I should possibly be able to hold out. But my means are ebbing very fast, notwithstanding the observance of the strictest economy. My profession, I do not practise; and I am now thoroughly satisfied that, under its ordinary form, I never shall be able to do so. The painful truth is that there is in my present composition an insurmountablephysicalobstacle to my ever speaking in public, I daily become more & more convinced of. If I ever am to practise law, it must therefore, be with mypen, instead of my tongue; and consequently, on another theatre. The pecuniary inducement, besides a strong personal regard for Mr D, was then great. On the other hand, I was deterred both by a strong sense of utter want of capacity for this pursuit, and a rooted aversion for every thing connected with it. The objections preponderated; and after some hesitation, I gave a conclusive reply against the proposition. From this determination, however, the advice of Mr Jefferson R. added to that of Mr Davis, has induced me to depart; and I now stand committed as one of the Editors of the Advocate. As to the politics of the paper, in regard to the questions now on the carpet; there are few points on which my reflexions, so far as they have gone, have not led me to very different views from those which it has advocated. On these points, however, I am no zealot; and moreover, if I were, I see no principle which would prohibit a man’s owning a share in a press advocating different views from those entertained by himself: unless, indeed, hisnamealone were capable of lending to it a weight which it would not otherwise possess. Such is not the case in this instance: my name is not known to more than fifty persons in the world; and, whatever internal influence I may possess, being exerted in favor of candor & moderation, the sides of those questions which carry with them my good wishes, cannot, at least, be prejudiced by the measure. It is one of altogether a temporary character: for we are all beginning to turn our eyes very seriously towards the south; and ageneralmove, within a year or two, is by no means an impossibility.\nPrevious to the receipt of your letter, I had purposed writing by the approaching post, on the subject of Lewis Randolph. His education may now be said to befairlyunder way; and, could he be secured for two or three years, in a situation favorable to pursuing it, I should entertainconsiderableexpectations of him. This however, will not be his good fortune, (for under the present prospects of the family, he will be inevitably hurried into some lucrative employment) unless he can obtain some place that will support him. While reflecting on this subject the other day, it occurred to me that I heard some time ago it was Mr Wirtembaker’s intention shortly to commence the practice of the law. The place of librarian would be very acceptable to Lewis; and I would pledge myself to his proper discharge of it. I determined therefore, to write without loss of time, lest some other application should be made; and to request you to mention the subject to the other visitors, the first time you communicate with them. If he could be made secure of receiving the situation when the vacancy shall occur; he might, at once commence shaping his course in reference thereto.\nMr Randolph sets out to-day for the north, viā Richmond, to adopt measures for the publication of the papers. This trip will probably expedite the return of his mother, by a week or two. He carries with him a list of the paintings and busts; for which boxes are now making, for the purpose of sending them immediately to Boston. The directors of the Atheneum there, have offered to exhibit them gratis; and it is thought to be the most favorable market. Your likeness with that of Mr Jefferson, will be of the party; but only to beexhibited: and, I suppose, copied.\nMr ____________ is now living here. He occupies the north pavilion,en hermite; his meals are sent to him: and we have strong hopes that this state of things will continue after her return.\nWe all unite in very affectionate salutations to Mrs Madison & yourself\nNichs: Ph: Trist\nMay I presume so far on your kindness as to ask you to read a number signed the ’spirit of 87’ which will appear in the Advocate of next week; and, not write, but tell me when I next have the pleasure of seeing you, whether it is satisfactory."

We take, therefore, this earliest opportunity to assure you, that we love and admire the federal constitution, not merely because it is the result and display of the collected wisdom of our own country; but especially, because its principles are the principles of liberty, both civil and religious, and of the rights of Man. We contemplate the general government as “the sheet anchor of our peace at home, and safety abroad.” We sincerely respect all the constituted authorities of our country. We regard the Presidency with a cordial attachment, and profound respect. But, Sir, we do not regard you, merely, as the dignified functionary of this august office. That you are an American, both in birth, and principle, excites in us sensations of more exalted pleasure. We revere your talents—are assured of your patriotism, and rely on your fidelity. More than this,—our hearts, in unison with your own, reverberate the political opinions you have been pleased to announce in your inaugural Speech.—Having said this, we need not add that you may assure yourself of our constant and faithful support, while you carry into effect your own rules of government.\nYour disposition expressed in plainly delineating, in your inaugural Address, and ina particular instance of a more recent date, the chart by which you propose to direct the course of the political ship, on board of which we have embarked the best of our temporal interests, invites a reciprocity of communication. Under this indulgence, we are constrained to express some of our most ardent wishes.—May the general government draw around the whole nation, such lines of defence, as shall prove forever impassable to any foreign foe; may it secure to the several States, as well thereality, as theformof republican Government; may it ever respect those Governments as the most “competent for our domestic concerns, and cherish them as the surest bulwarks against anti republican tendencies”; and effectually protect them against any possible encroachments on each other. may it effectually extend to us, and to every Individual of our fellow citizens, all that protection to which the state governments may be foundincompetent. While it thus defends us, against ourselves, and all the world, may it leave every Individual to the free pursuit of his own object, in his own way. May the means of defraying the expence necessarily incurred by these measures, be drawn from all the Inhabitants, in as just proportion to their respective ability, as is possible. May your administration be found, on experiment, to be effectually instrumental in adapting all the subordinate offices of government to the real accommodation of the great public; and, of annexing such a specific compensation to the discharge of every trust, as shall invite the ready acceptance of modest ability, and distinguished merit,—while the avaricious, the ambitious, and the luxurious, shall see in it, no allurement; and may no one description of citizens be ever favoured at the expense of any other.\nLiberty herself demands these restrictions,—and these indulgencies are all she asks.\nThus administered, our government will stand fast, on the surest basis—that of public opinion,—nor will it need the mercenary support of any privileged class of men, however influencial they may be. May He whose Kingdom ruleth over all, direct, and bless your whole Administration, and yourself.\nSigned on behalf, & by order.\nAmos MarshSpeaker"

I delivered next Day Early in the morning Your Excellency’s Letter to the President of Congress, & I am informed but to day that the Board of War is charged to Confer with me on the present State of the Army.\nI do not know as yet what this Conference will tend to, There is a talk of a Committee being to repair to Camp, in Order to give a new formation to our Army; It is Spoken likewise of incorporating 41 Regiments, but I really believe that nothing is yet determined upon this Subject.\nThe Minister of France has communicated to me that he is on the point of asking of Congress what means they intend to Employ for the Operations of the next Campaign, that he may give notice to his Court & to the Chiefs of Squadrons to make their Arrangements in Consequence.\nHe has given me certain Assurances that We may reckon on the Arrival of a French Fleet upon our Coast, in case We are able to Cooperate on our Side.\nHe has told me he has sent his Opinion to Your Excellency on the Subject of the Cartel proposed by the Enemy.\nI have just received an Order from the Board of War, to attend at their Office to morrow at 6 o’clock.P.M.\nSeveral Gentlemen in Congress, & Especially the Eastern Members appear Extremely well disposed to reinforce the Army for next Campaign, & to do all in their Power to promote Vigorous Operations. there are indeed, different Schemes proposed, but I shall not contradict any, provided We have an Army.\nI have delivered to the Board of War, the Returns of the Infantry, & as far as I could, I have acquainted them with the state of our Army. I Am desired to give my Opinion without delay of the Preparations that are to be made for next Campaign.\nI delivered Yesterday to the Board of War the annexed Memorial. It is only a General Calculation which requires a more Exact Examination.\nThe Hon. Mr Livingston, a Member of Congress, was deputed on their part to the Board, he communicated the Answer of Your Excellency on the scheme of incorporating the Regiments.\nIf any thing should induce me to advise an Incorporation it would be the Vacancies of Officers, which I know not how We are to fill. I fear, however, it will produce a great deal of discontent, & other ill Consequences.\nMr Peters proposed to put off all Arrangement, & to consider in this moment only the number of Men which the respective states are to furnish for the next Campaign.\nThe number of Infantry which I have proposed in my Memorial was admitted, I represented however that it would be necessary to reckon on 40 Men more ⅌ Regiment, on account of the diminution which may happen from this Time to the beginning of next Campaign.\nMr Livingston objected against the number of Cavalry which I proposed, on account of the impossibility of mounting it. This Consideration was however suspended, not to defer the Calculation of the Men only.\nI have received an Order from the Board of War to procure without delay the Returns, the List of which is here Enclosed.\nI beg, Sir, You will interpose Your Authority that these Returns may be transmitted immediately.\nIt appears indispensably necessary to prohibit the distribution of the Arms, Cartridges &c. till the Quantity now in the Regiments & Magazines is well known & ascertained.\nI beg, dear General, You will let me know your Opinion of the proportion for an Army which you will find in my Memorial, as I wish to act solely by Your Excellency’s Direction. Be pleased, Sir, to honor me with your Confidence, & be assured that my Zeal for the service can only be Equalled by the profound respect with which I have the honor to be sir, Your Excellency’s Most obedient and Very humble servant\nsteuben"

Aprile. Mi prevalsi dell’occasione di due francesi, ⅌ i quali Mr. Jefferson mandò i suoi dispaccj, per mandarvi colla da. mia precedente, la prima parte del mio libro e i primi 4. foglj della seconda. Pochi giorni sono consegnai al Dr. Gibbons di Filadelfia il resto della seconda e i primi 4. foglj della terza. Ora gli mando a Havre con questa i due foglj seguenti. Con altra occasione vi manderò il resto della terza, e forse la quarta, cioè il tutto. Parmi d’avervi già scritto che questi che vi mando son foglj di prove. Non credo che potrò mandarvi gli esemplari bene stampati e legati prima della fin d’8bre. o del principio di 9bre. Spero che avrò prima d’allora ricevuto la vostra risposta alla mia precedente, nella quale mi direte la vostra opinione riguardo al numero che dovrei mandarne in America. Il figlio di Mr. Rutlidge è di parere che potrassene vendere 70, o 80. in Charlestoun, dove dice che la lingua francese è molto in voga.\nRiguardo all’affare di Dohrman, vi reitero le mie premure per la sbrigazione, giacchè per mia buona sorte avete avuto la bontà d’incaricarvene. Riposo intieramente sulla vostra amicizia. Il tutto si riduce a fargli cedere in pagamento di quel che mi dovrà una porzione del suo credito col Congresso, bastante a saldarmi al prezzo che i detti fondi si venderanno sulla piazza nel tempo della cessione. Voltato poi il mio credito col Congresso in testa dei Fratelli Van-Staphorst, essi non solo mi accorderannotempo, ma di più mi assisteranno per sollevarmi almeno in parte dalle mie angustie. Di grazia, procuratene la sbrigazione, e soprattutto è necessario di badare che Dohrman non ci faccia qualche brutto scherzo. Non vi sarebbe modo di prender passi tali che impedissero a lui di fare alcun’uso del suo credito col Congresso prima d’avermi sodisfatto? Di avere in somma una preferenza assicurata? Amico, io temo, e non senza ragione. Il mio timore dipende dalla mia trista situazione, dall’esperienza che ò degli uomini in generale, e di Mr. Dohrman in particolare. Ei mi scrisse, in data dei 15. Agosto 1786., che aveva convenuto con Monroe, di accordarmi l’interesse col cambio e ricambio principiando dal primo Gennaio 1786. Io gli sborsai il denaro nel Marzo precedente, la cambiale è dell’istessa data, onde non vedo una sola ragione per cui debba io perdere il cambio di 10. mesi contro l’uso e contro le leggi. Mi pare che i gravi danni già sofferti e da soffrirsi a motivo del disappunto, per il che Dohrman non è certamente scusabile, non richiedano da me nè in giustizia, nè in equità, ulteriori sacrifizj. Giacchè avete la bontà d’assistermi, vi prego di provveder che non mi sia fatto maggior torto, e di avvertirmi se in ciò che mi scrisse Dohrman vi è sbaglio, o almeno farmi sapere il motivo che indusse Monroe ad accordare una tal cosa.\nIl Marchese de la F. vi egli comunicato ciò che noi pensiamo riguardo al Mediterraneo? Vi par’egli che io potessi esser’utile. Non posso scrivere di più: amico, addio. Tutto vostro,\nFilippo Mazzei.\nSigillate le lettere di Edmond e del Bellini, dopo lette, se ne avete il tempo e la pazienza.\n18. 7bre.\nDall’inclusa, diretta a Edmond R; o piuttosto da quella che scrivo a de Rieux inclusa ad E; vedrete la causa del ritardo di questa, delle due dette e di quella del Bellini, coi due foglj E, F.\nSpero che il Dr. Gibbons vi avrà recapitato il compimento della seconda parte del mio libro e i primi 4. foglj della terza. Ora vi aggiungo il compimento della terza, e una lettera per il vostro cugino non sigillata. Ve ne includo una per Mr. Oster il quale non so se ora stia a Norfolk o in Williamsburgo. La lettera diretta al Minghini mi è fortemente raccomandata dall’Agente di Toscana. Se poteste farla recapitar sicuramente e farmi pervenir la risposta, mi fareste favore.\nRiguardo ai miei affari non potrei che ripetervi quanto contiene la precedente. Aspetto con grande ansietà la vostra risposta, con una consolante notizia del resultato nelle Convenzione di Filadelfia. Addio."

    "content": "Charleston 4th. April 1787.\nDear Sir\nI have lately been favoured with your Letter of 18th. Novr. which went to New York, and from thence came to me here by the Post. You mention the Hague, and are so obliging as to wish methere: for this mark of your friendship, be pleased to accept of my thanks. Had the funds of the United States allowed them to make the appointment you allude to last year, I would have accepted of it, and devoted three years of my life to their service. At present I feel much disinclined to it, and most heartily wish that Mr. Madison may be elected whenever the Finances of Congress will admit of it. He is a Member of the Continental Convention which is to meet in Philadelphia next Month for the purpose of revising the articles of Confederation. If the powers of Congress can be so far extended as to give efficacy to the decisions of that body, the measure will assuredly contribute to the security, and happiness, of the Continent. At present our affairs are by no means in a desireable state. I agree with you perfectly in opinion respecting the propriety of our cultivating the closest, and most intimate connexion with France. We have already derived great benefits from her, and much greater may still be expected. We are under considerable obligations to you for your exertions respecting the Commerce of every part of the Continent, and I am confident that very beneficial consequences will result from a continuance of them. The copy of the Letter from M. de Calonne to you, which you enclosed me, shews the good disposition of the Ministry towards us. Much remains however yet to be done; and I am happy to think that whatever extension is given to the Commerce of America may, by good management be made beneficial to France. I should be very glad if their Manufactories could supply us as well, and as cheap as those of England with the coarse articles which are absolutely necessary in this Country. I mean Negro Cloth, Blankets, and implements of Husbandry. When I was in Paris I procured from London a yard of Negro Cloth called there White Plains, and a broad Hoe, and gave them to M. Abeille, who was a Member of a Society for the promotion of Commerce. The Cloth is near a yard wide, perfectly white, very substantial, and comfortable wear for Negroes, and is from 12 to 14½ Pence Sterling pr. Yard by the Piece. The Broad Hoes are from 17 to 18 shillings, and 6 pence a Dozen, and very good. Blankets 4 Shillings, and 3 pence each. I have just copied these articles with their prices from an Invoice lately received from Messrs. Mannings & Vaughan in London, for the use of my Plantations: they were all remarkably good. M. Abeille told me that the Manufacturers of France would soon be able to supply us with the articles I have mentioned, as good, and as cheap. I wish this could be done; and if it could I am persuadedthat four fifths of the Planters in this State would deal with France in preference to England. You say that France could consume our whole Crop of Rice. This might easily be done if the matter were put in a proper train. It would give me much pleasure to see it, and returns made entirely in the Manufactures, Wines &c. of France. It is supposed that France contains 24 Millions of Inhabitants. If each of them were to consume two pounds of Rice in a year, the amount would be 96,000 Barrels of 500 ₶., which is more than our annual export of that article since the War. I have seen your Letter to Mr. Jay, in which you mention the comparative goodness of our Rice with that of Italy; and you think ours is not sent to Market in as good order as theirs. In this I am persuaded you are mistaken. When I was in Italy I visited some of the best Rice Plantations in that Country, and was surprized to find how inferior their management of the grain was to ours, after they had got it into the Barn Yard. You may observe how much whiter our Rice is than theirs, which must be owing to that circumstance. Our Rice is more broken than theirs, which is occasioned by two causes: they clean it less than we do, and their grain is thicker in proportion to its length, resembling Barley, which makes it less liable to be broken by the Pestle. I have seen the Grocers in Paris employed in picking out the whole grains from the broken ones. This is a needless trouble as one is just as good as the other. If you have observed the same thing perhaps that may have led you to think that our Rice was not in as good order as the Italian. I am desirous of trying how their Rice would succeed in this Country: and for that reason should be obliged to you if you could procure, and send me any quantity of the seed from one to ten Bushels. It might easily be shipped for this Place from Marseilles; and the best seeds should be chosen. I was in hopes that you might have been able to have induced the Portugueze to receive our Rice on the same terms they did before the War. Lisbon used to take from us annually 20,000 Barrels, and now there is none sent there, which is a considerable disadvantage to us. If Honfleur is made a free Port, with proper management the greatest part of the Rice which would otherwise be sent to Cowes, might be drawn thither. It might be made a Depot for all the goods of Europe consumed by America, and the Ships of this Country, and of France, might return at once with whatever they wanted, without having the trouble of going farther up the Channel. This would be a stroke at the carrying Trade of England, and diminish in a considerable degree the Nursery oftheir Seamen. France would unquestionably be benefitted by this. In my opinion a proper judgment of her prosperity can never be formed abstractedly. That of England must be her Scale. Upon this Idea my opinion was formed respecting the restrictions on our Trade to the West India Islands. If they were entirely removed from those of France, England would be under the necessity of following the example, and her Seamen would be diminished. Her strength, and prosperity depend entirely on the number of her Seamen; but France has internal resources; and a great Marine is only necessary to her, because her Rival is possessed of one. Mr. Barrett’s proposals are not very tempting: any Merchant in France, Holland, or England will receive consignments upon terms more advantageous to the shipper in this Country. I am well acquainted with the character and solidity of Messrs. le Coulteux’ House, and think they might be the means of establishing an intercourse very advantageous to the two Countries: but not by such proposals as are contained in Mr. Barrett’s letter. Too strict an adherence to immediate profit will not effect a dissolution of old connexions, and long established prejudices. At the same time the present situation of our affairs makes it necessary for an European Merchant to be very circumspect in his dealings with this Country. Though his profits may at first be small, his security ought to be good. The War bore particularly hard upon this State, most of us have been considerably injured, and I have had my share of the public calamity. I find myself about £8,000 Sterlg. in debt, with an Estate which ought not to feel any inconvenience from such a Sum. I wish however to pay it off, and to have but one Creditor. If Messrs. Le Couteulx, or any other substantial House in Paris would pay my Bills to that amount, I would engage to remit them annually 600 Barrels of Rice of 500 French pounds weight neat each, till the whole debt should be paid, and 5 per Cent interest on each Balance. If the Bills could be made payable in London I should prefer it, because they always command a better price. I would give security to three times the amount of the sum borrowed, which should be satisfactory to the Agent of the Lender. I wish not to give you any trouble about this matter; but if you could effect it without much difficulty it would oblige me, and be of service to me.\nI am with great regard Dear Sir Your most obt. Servant,\nRa.Izard\nHave you received the Laws of this State, and the Newspapersby M. Chatteaufort? The Printer has orders to send the Papers for you regularly to Mr. Jay as you desire, and he tells me it has been done."

    "content": "[1762?–1764]\nYou may acquaint the gentleman that desired you to enquire my opinion of the best method of securing a powder magazine from lightning, that I think they cannot do better than to erect a mast not far from it, which may reach 15 or 20 feet above the top of it, with a thick iron rod in one piece fastened to it, pointed at the highest end, and reaching down through the earth till it comes towater. Iron is a cheap metal; but if it were dearer, as this is a publick thing, the expence is insignificant; therefore I would have the rod at least an inch thick, to allow for its gradually wasting by rust; it will last as long as the mast, and may be renewed with it. The sharp point for five or six inches should be gilt.\nBut there is another circumstance of importance to the strength, goodness, and usefulness of the powder, which does not seem to have been enough attended to: I mean the keeping it perfectly dry. For want of a method of doing this, much is spoilt in damp magazines, and much so damaged as to become of little value. If instead of barrels it were kept in cases of bottles well cork’d; or in large tin canisters, with small covers shutting close by means of oil’d paper between, or covering the joining on the canister; or if in barrels, then the barrels lined with thin sheet lead; no moisture in either of these methods could possibly enter the powder, since glass and metals are both impervious to water.\nBy the latter of these means you see tea is brought dry and crisp from China to Europe, and thence to America, tho’ it comes all the way by sea in the damp hold of a ship. And by this method, grain, meal, &c. if well dry’d before ’tis put up, may be kept for ages sound and good.\nThere is another thing very proper to line small barrels with; it is what they call tin-foil, or leaf-tin, being tin mill’d between rollers till it becomes as thin as paper, and more pliant, at the same time that its texture is extreamly close. It may be apply’d to the wood with common paste, made with boiling water thicken’d with flour; and, so laid on, will lie very close and stick well: But I should prefer a hard sticky varnish for that purpose, made of linseed oil much boil’d. The heads might be lined separately, the tin wrapping a little round their edges. The barrel while the lining is laid on, should have the end hoops slack, so that the staves standing at a little distance from each other, may admit the head into its groove. The tin-foil should be plyed into the groove. Then one head being put in, and that end hoop’d tight, the barrel would be fit to receive the powder, and when the other head is put in and the hoops drove up, the powder would be safe from moisture even if the barrel were kept under water. This tin-foil but about 18 pence sterling a pound, and is so extreamly thin, that I imagine a pound of it would line three or four powder barrels. I am &c.\nB.F."

Dept. and a Commission for Freeman ordered to be made out without delay.\nPoinsett promises, by his qualifications, every thing to be expected from a substitute for Gelston. I have sent the returned papers to the Dept. of State, that new ones may be forwarded to you. It was always my idea that the Country beyond the Andes should be joined to B. A: but it seems I failed to impart it. The document will now specify, both a port in Peru & Chili, as within the range of Mr. P. if visitable by him. Should these come to you blank, you will fill them with Ports best combining commercial importance & proximity to the Seats of Govt. Your hints as to Sumpter & the Span⟨ish &⟩ Brasilian relations to S. Ama. have been attended to. Rio Jano. is in every view an eligible route for Mr. P. An advance of$1500 is stated to the Dept. of State. It may be well for you to suggest the best mode of making it from the Treasy. Secresy as far as possible is desireable. It will not do to apply for a Spanish passport, altho I fear the want of it may be a serious difficulty; unless Sumpter’s letters of introduction, should answer an equivalent purpose. The Spanish Consul at Balt: on discovering that Lowry was going to Caraccas, entered a formal complaint on the ground that it was contrary to the Colonial system. And to ask a passport, as for a private person, to cover a political one would not, of course, be allowable; if in these suspicious times, it were not probably unattainable.\nI inclose, at the request of Mr. Jefferson, a note to a paragraph in his case of the Batture contained in my last; intended to make his argument more clear & apposite.\nThe last dispatch from Armstrong is no later than May 24. It relates merely to the proceedings under the Rambouillet decree. Mr. Graham, mentions a letter from Warden of June 10. as unimportant. I have a private letter from A. of May 24., which contains the passage following: “The Imp: Decree of Mar. 23. sufficiently indicates its own cause—tho’ from the personal explanations given to me, it wd. appear to have been less the result of the law itself than of its non-execution, which was construed & with some plausibility into a partiality for English Commerce. ’My wishes & interests (said the Emperor the other day) both lead to a free & friendly connection with the U. S. but I can not see with indifference on the part of this power, measures which expressly favor the trade of my enemy. Such is their non-intercourse law, wch. by its own provisions, however faithfully executed, wd. not be equal in its operation, but which so far from being faithfully executed, has been violated with impunity from its date to the present day, much to my prejudice, & greatly to the advantage of the Brit: commerce’—The error in this reasoning is in not going farther back for premises.” He glances at some faint indications of jealousy between F. & Russia, and at an anticipated marriage between a Prince of Prussia, & a daughter of Lucien Bonaparte. In a preceding letter he alludes to a like one between Ferdinand & the 2d. daughter of the Emp: Francis, with a view to its bearings on S. America, & warns us, that a Champ de Battaille, may then be found with the U. S.\nI have a long letter from Judge Toulmin, which authenticates the reality of a combination, headed by Caller & Kenady, for the purpose of occupying Mobille &c. The object is not denied, and impunity avowedly inferred, from the impossibility of finding a jury to convict. The partyengaged amounts, as given out, to abount [sic] 400. The conquest is to be offered to the U. S. Kenady is said to be on a visit to Georgia to consult the Senators of that State, whose advice is to be followed. It is not improbable therefore, as is intimated, that this movement is intended to cover a retreat from the project. The Commandant at Fort Stoddart has written for reinforcements; which are eligible, if practicable, in a general reference to that Quarter.\nYou will have seen the projected Constn: for W. Florida & noted among other particulars, the power to the Temporary Govt. togrant lands. Should it become necessary, for the Ex. to exercise authority within those limits, before the meeting of Congs. I foresee many legal difficulties. What is to be done on the subject of the Custom House, in such an event? Be assured of my esteem & best wishes\nJames Madison"

    "content": "Virginia. Septr. 16. 1803.\nSir.\nMy present absence from the office of State puts it out of my power to refer to all the letters from you not yet acknowledged. The last received was of the 12th. of August. The preceeding one on the boundaries of Louisiana &c. &c. has not yet reached me. All the information you may be able to give on that subject, and on every other made interesting by the late cession from France, will be highly acceptable. You will have received an enumeration of various objects to which your attention will be particularly drawn: To these your own judgment, assisted by your local knowledge, will probably be able to make valuable additions. A letter from Govr. Claiborne, received by the same mail with yours, conveys information concurring with the opinion that the Prefect meditates obstacles to the delivery of Louisiana into our Hands. It is presumable however that so much temerity, if not secretly favored by his Government, must speedily yield to reflection, and it is not a natural supposition that the French Government should wish to embarrass or frustrate, in the midst of a war with Great Britain, a transaction, which the prospect of such a war contributed doubtless to enforce on its policy: Still it will be proper, considering the peculiarities incident to personal character & the vicissitudes incident to politicalaffairs, that every circumstance should be marked & communicated, which may deserve attention in the arrangements to be made in so important a case. But whatever may be the real purposes of the French Prefect, there is ground to believe that Spain, either alarmed by the cession of so much Territory to the United States, or hoping to make her consent the price of concessions on their part, may be so unwise as to oppose the execution of the measure. With a view to such a posture of things, the President wishes you to watch every symtom [sic] which may shew itself, and to sound in every direction where discoveries may be most practicable, proceeding at the same time with all the caution necessary to avoid suspicion. You will please to let us know also what force Spain has in the Country, where it is posted, what are its dispositions, how the Inhabitants would act in case a force should be marched thither from the United States, and what numbers of them could be armed & actually brought into opposition to it. You will be sensible that the value of information on those points may depend much on the dispatch with which it is forwarded, and will therefore need no exortation to that effect. I am &c.\nJames Madison."

Whenever the money is raisd it of course becomes due and payable to whomsoever has a right in Mrs Bernard to demand it; and before this I do not see what more is to be expected of Us than to raise it as fast as we can. this is the light in which the matter appears to me upon a general re-view of it, but I am open to conviction, and shall always recede from error so soon as I am convincd that I am in one.

If so it needs no other recommendation to insure your active support and consequent success The object is a subscription Brewery proposed to be established at Washington with a moderate Capital for the purpose of improving, encouraging, and extending the brewing trade of America in a way well calculated to insure this result and whilst engaged in effecting this great National purpose the experiment could not fail (under proper management) of handsomely repaying its patriotick supporters See theoutlines of the Planinclosed\nYou will also find the copy of a preface proposed to be annexed to a small practicaltreatiseon Brewing & Malting which I have now nearly ready for the press to be entitled the American brewer Incontra-distinctionto the work entitled the American Distiller If it only meet a like EncouragemtI will not be without Some reward for my trouble although I can with truth declare pecuniary considerations are not exclusively my object: but principally an earnest desire to improve and encourage the Brewing trade of America, which If my view of its importance be correct whether considered in a National, commercial, or agricultural point of view, most certainly deserves the encouragement of all classes of our population, Independent of its great influence on their health and Morals—Some of the new and most useful processes intended to be given in this work are the following\nA new and better mode of Malting Indian corn by which this grain now principally devoted to thedestructivepurposes of the Distillery can be converted into good Malt and made a valuable addition to Brewing materials. Another is a simple, and easy process of making beer, only a week brewed, assume all the appearances of age, possessingtransparencyflavour, and above all the preserving quality so essential to good beer. A third process is makga good and preserving beer from bran and Shorts without Malt, this Process in many situations Where Malt is not easily procured will be found useful. A fourth process peculiarly adapted to Gentlemen, farmers, and house-Keepers, as economical, and giving but little trouble is a method of brewing, and fermenting beer by close fermentation: suffering neither yeast nor feculencies to escape at the bung hole. this simple and easy process makes a transparent pungent beer, which seems to improve whilst any remains in the Cask and by no means subject to turnsour, or flat as is common with other beer. There are many other matters that I trust will be found new and useful in a work of this Kind. by the notice proposed to be given with the preface you will perceive it is contemplated to add an Accotof wine making and Tanning on an improved plan as is now practiced in France. The work will be printed with large tipe and on good Paper Price to subscribers $2.—in boardsthis is half the price that is asked forMorrises Small work on brewingwhich I trust in point of usefulness, will not bear a comparisson with the one I am now about to present the Publick. If you permit me I will have the honor of putting down your name as a Subscriber but whether permitted or not believe me with sentiments of high respect and regard\nP.S living somewhat out of the City compells me to have my letters Addressed to the house of a friend—"

Mr. Sprague, and in compliance with your request, I inclose autographs of certain individuals such as you refer to. I would willingly have given with their names more of their writing, but could not do it without mutilating the sense, or embracing matter of a private nature. There is particularly a difficulty where the letter does not close on thefirstor thethirdpage. Several other Autographs would have been added, those of P. Henry, G. Wythe, Gco. Mason &c &c but it was found that their letters on my files had been taxed to the full in that way.\nIn the year 1828, I recd. from J. V. Buren sundry numbers of the \"Savannah Georgian\", containingcontinuationsof the Notes of Majr. Pierce in the Federal Convention of 1787. They were probably sent on account of a marginal suggestion of inconsistency between language held by me in the Convention, with regard to an Executive Veto, and a use made of the power by myself when in the Executive Administration. The inconsistency is done away by the distinction not adverted to between anabsoluteVeto, to which the language was applied, and thequalifiedVeto which was exercised. I avail myself, Sir, of your proffered kindness, by asking you to procure for me, if it can be conveniently done, such of the numbers of the \"Georgian,\" preceding No. 124. Apl. 21. 1828, and succeeding No. 129. Apl. 26. 1828, as contain notes of Majr. Pierce in that Convention; forwarding with them the charge of the Editors which will be remitted to them. It will be matter of curiosity, at least, to compare the notes taken on the same subjects by different members of the Body.\nIf Mr. Sprague be still with you, be pleased to make known to him, that his letter was received and duly appreciated, and to accept for yourself my respects and salutations.\nJames Madison"

Indeed I shall be out in my conjecture (for it is only conjecture), if the late imbarkation at New York, is not for Delaware river, to cooperate with the Army under the immediate command of Genl Howe, who I am informed from good authority is with the British Troops and his whole force upon this Route.\nI have no certain intelligence of Genl Lee, although I have sent frequent Expresses to him and lately a Colo. Humpton to bring me some accurate Accounts of his situation. I last night dispatched another Gentn to him—Major Hoops, desiring he would hasten his march to the Delaware in which I would provide Boats near a place called Alexandria for the transportation of his Troops. I can not account for the slowness of his March.\nIn the disordered & moving state of the Army I cannot get returns, but from the best accounts we had between Three thousand & 3500 Men before the Philadelphia Militia and German Batallion arrived, they amount to about Two thousand.

July 30th. 1801.\nDear Sir\nPermit me, tho’ at this late hour, to express my happy feelings at the issue of the Election of Chief & second Majestrates, and the consequent changes in the principal Executive Offices, which promise Us a wise, Constitutional, & Eocomical [sic] Administration of the Federal Government for at least four years; & I hope much longer, which will be the case, if the Republican Citizens do not abate of their Vigilance in their Elective power.\nI know it has been a trite charge On Us by our Enemies, that Our Opposition to Adm[inistrati]on proceeded from a hankering after the loaves & fishes—which if in some instances true, was far from being so reprehensible as those who were fattening with them, would represent; since when a great body of Citizens found themselves, on Account of their Zeal for the Constitution & good Government, wholly excluded from a share in those Offices, to the expence of which they contributed equally with others, & to which they had equal claims, they had just cause to complain, & attempt a remedy: Nor do I think it a reflection on the Character of any Citizen, to offer himself a Candidate for a Vacant Office. These Observations are a preface to my introducing to you Our friend Mr. Hubbard Taylor of Kentucky, who writes me that the Office of Marshal of that state is Vacant, that he wishes to be appointed to it, and supposing I have some Interest with the President, requests I will use it [in] his behalf. If I possess the supposed Honor, I would by no means abuse it, but can truly say of Mr. Taylor, that I think him a man of great Attention & dilligence in any business he undertakes, and of the most unshaken integrity: And what may be important, he is an influential Character in the State, and would be probably generally approved of. This you will be pleased to state to the President, & present him my best respects.\nWhilst writing, permit me to mention the Revd. Mr. Abner Waugh, a Minister of the Episcopal Church, who growing in years, is anxious to settle in some Town, to avoid the fatigue of travelling on Countrey duty. He means to trie the City of Washington in the course of this year, where I wish him to succede [sic]. He is an agreable preacher of the most tolerant Spirit—An able tutor of youth, and as a man, may be truly ranked amongst the most unexceptionable. I believe he means to be a Candidate for theChaplaincy of the House of Representatives, in which, or in any other way, if you can assist him, you will find the favor, bestowed on a most worthy object, and will be esteemed a particular kindness to me, who am with Sentiments of the highest esteem & respect, Dear Sir, Yr.

I am glad he has, but it makes the poor fellows of the 4th feel, for the neglect shewn them, especialy as they think, they have at least as much title to attention as any Regiment of horse in the Service—there are a few Recruits picked up, and they tell me 750 dollars is given as a bounty, by Major Lee, & others recruiting westward of us, I wish to Know from your Excellency whether I am entitled to give that bounty, as I have promisd the utmost given by any Officers recruiting for the Cavalry—it Sickens me to See the 4th Regiment mouldering away, every day now, Carries off, Some, whose times are up, and I have no inducements to offer for encourageing their reinlisting, badly paid with money that will not purchass an egg in this place, no bread to eat, and Seeing themselves and those whom they leave behind almost naked, these are not inducements for Continueing in the Service.\nhow the Officers manage, is to me inconceiveable. I do declare that if I had not drawn upon France for 100 guineas, which by great Oeconomy Carries me thorough, I shoud not be able to get the necessaries of Life, when things are at the worst, they will mend, is the proverb. I hope it will prove true in the present instance—a Report prevails that Your Excellency is to move Head Qrs to the Southward, my ambition is to Serve where Your Excellency immediatly Commands the Army, if it shoud be true I hope you will not leave me behind you. I have the honor to be Dear Sir Your Most obliged H. St\nStephen Moylan"

April Instant by the Honble Mr. Madison in these words Vizt. “Resolved that the present State of the negociations with Spain and of the Affairs of the United States, renders it expedient that the minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of France, should proceed under a Special Commission to the Court of Madrid, there to make such Representations, and to urge such negociations, as will be most likely to impress on the said Court the friendly Disposition of the United States, and to induce it to make such concessions and arrangements touching the Southern Limit of the United States and their Right to Navigate the Missisippi below the same, and to enter into such Commercial Stipulations with the United States, as may most effectually guard against a Rupture of the subsisting Harmony and promote^the^mutual Interests of the two Nations.[”]\n“Resolved that the Secretary for foreign Affairs prepare and Report the Instructions proper to be given to the said Minister Plenipotentiary, with a proper Commission and Letter of Credence; and that he also report the communications and explanations which it may be adviseable to make to Mr. Gardoqui relative to this change in the mode of conducting the negociations with his Court.[”]\nReports\nThe first Question that this motion presents, is whether it will be expedient to endeavour to carry the Spanish negociation from New York to Madrid.\nIt is generally and with Reason held to be more honorable to a nation that foreign Powers should send Ambassadors to Treat with their Sovereign at his own House, than that they should send Ambassadors to treat with a foreign sovereign at his Court.\nIt is also, and with equal Reason generally deemed more advantageous to negociate at Home than in a distant Country; because in thelattercase, much must be confided to the Discretion of the negociator, and because the Distance prevents his consulting and being directed by his Sovereign on unexpected occasions and Events as they rise and which sometimes require immediate Decision.\nAs these Considerations afford strong and weighty Reasons for continuing the present negociation at the seat of Congress, those for carrying it to Madrid should clearly preponderate before they are permitted to operate that change.\nTwo Reasons are assigned for the proposed Change. one of them is exceedingly indefinite Vizt. thepresent State of our Affairs —what particular Facts and Circumstances in the present State of our Affairs are alluded to, your Secretary is at a loss to discern; for he does not know of any that would in his opinion be meliorated by the change.\nThe other Reason is thepresent State of the negociation with that he is perfectly well acquainted, but if the negociation goes to Madrid, he does not conceive that it will leave behind it any of the Difficulties, Questions, or Embarrassments which perplex and retard it at New York.\nThe Reasons therefore assigned in the motion for the measure in Question do not appear to him adequate to the consequences drawn from them.\nShould such a measure be adopted, the Court of Spain will doubtless view it as very singular, and from that circumstance be disposed to suspect that it originated in other than the avowed Inducements—why should Congress forego the Honor and Convenience of treating with us at Home? Ifdiscontented with their own negociator, why this circuitous way of changing him? if with ours, how has it happened that no Symptoms of it have appeared? on the contrary we are well informed that he is esteemed and respected in America: as to the Differences between us how are they diminished by this measure? These and a variety of other Questions will more readily occur to the Spanish Court, than satisfactory answers to them and your Secretary apprehends that all these Investigations will terminate in a firm belief that a design to gain Time and to amuse was the true Reason. Whether such a suspicion would be well or ill founded, would be unimportant; for its operation would be exactly the same in the one case as in the other. The only Question is whether it is not highly probable, nay almost certain that they would impute it to that cause?\nYour Secretary has Reason to believe that Mr. Gardoqui as well as some others, are not ill informed of interesting Debates in Congress, and that the Conversation of members out of Doors does not always remain sub Rosa. How or in which^at^point of Light, the Design of such a measure would strike him, your Secretary can only conjecture. It is however natural to suppose that he would take no pains to prevent its proving abortive, and that his Representations of it to his Court would not be calculated to give it a welcome Reception there, nor to impress them with a favourable opinion of the Purposes intended by it.\nWhen too the Court of Spain finds that Mr. Jefferson is only empowered toconferabout the Missisippi and the Boundaries but not toconclude; their suspicions of a Design to Delay and amuse would be confirmed, for it is observable that the motion proposes only to authorize him toenter into commercial stipulations—on the other topics he is tomake Representations,to urge such negociations as will be most likely toimpresson the Court the friendly Disposition of the United States, and toinduceit to make concessions &c. but not a word that gives him power toconcludea Treaty on those Points. Perhaps this may only be an inadvertent Inaccuracy in the motion, if not it gives much Colour to the Inferences above suggested.\nAll the^se^considerations and circumstances combined induce your Secretary to think it highly probable that his Catholic Majesty will not consent to treat at Madrid, that his opinion of the candor of the United States will be diminished by the measure in question, and that he will direct his Minister here to state his ultimate propositions explicitly to Congress, and to insist on a speedy and Categorical answer.\nIf such would be theprobableconsequence of the measure proposed, your Secretary thinks it would be hazarding too much to adopt it.\nIf Congress should notwithstanding think it expedient to transfer the negociation to Madrid your Secretary is convinced that it cannot be confided to a Person better qualified to manage it than Mr. Jefferson; and in that case your Secretary will with alacrity and Zeal do whatever may depend upon him to promote the success of it.\nAll which is submitted to the Wisdom of Congress\nJohn Jay"

Whether there is any person living upon a small Tract he holds at the Great Meadows—what sort of an improvment is thereon—of whom the person took it and upon what terms —And should Mr Lewis have a favourable opportunity, the General would be obliged to him for informing those Settlers upon his tract West of the Monongahela, on the waters of Shurtee’s & Raccoon creeks, that he has a Patent for the Land, dated the 5th day of July 1774—that he will most assuredly assert his right to it—but, in consideration of their having made improvmentsthereon ignorantly, or under a mistaken belief, founded on false assertions, that the Land did not belong to him; he is willing that they should remain upon it as Tenants, upon a just & moderate Rent, such as he & they can agree upon. The like may be said to any Person or Persons who may be settled at a place called the Round Bottom, on the Ohio opposite Pipe Creek & a little above a Creek called Capteening, which has been surveyed by the county Surveyor of Augusta upon proper Warrants from Lord Dunmore, ever since the 14th day of July 1773.\nIf Mr Lewis can discover by indirect means who would be a fit Agent in the Neighbourhood of Fort Pitt to charge with the seating & leasing the Generals Lands in that country without holding up Ideas to them which may lead any one to expect the appointment; he would thank him for the information.\nSuch parts of these requests as can be complied with before his departure from Fort Pitt, the General would be obliged by receiving them (in a letter) from that place, as he is desirous of getting some knowledge of his affairs in that Country, as soon as possible."

    "content": "Baltimore, 14th January, 1798.\nSir,\nI have in my last indisputably proved that Col. Cresap was not concerned in the death of Logan’s family, since it is admitted that they were killed on some part of the waters of the Ohio, on the west side of the Alleghany Mountains, and not until the spring of the year 1774: whereas Colonel Cresap never was on the western side of those mountains after the summer of 1773.\nI now proceed to prove from the different facts I have stated in the sketch of his life, that Col. Cresap was not considered infamous for his murders of the inoffensive Indians; and that he ought not to have been so reputed.\nInmy letter to Mr. Fennell, I have said “he was a man of most undaunted bravery;” were these letters designed to circulate no farther than Col. Cresap was, or than I am personally known, I would not here introduce the testimony of two of his most respectable cotemporaries, in support of this my assertion.—I have before me a certificate dated the 31st of August, in the year 1747, in the hand writing of the Honorable Daniel Dulany, Esqr. signed by him, and the Hon. Benjamin Tasker, Esqr. both of the Province of Maryland, wherein they certify, “that they had been many years acquainted with Col. Thomas Cresap, that he Mr. Dulany had dealt considerably with him, and found him to be an honest and fair man:” They add, “which is his general character, except among somefewPennsylvanians, who have treated him with great cruelty, and in view of causing him to be disliked by others, have aspersed him; and that he is a man ofunquestionable resolution, will not, we believe, be denied by hisworst enemies, as the proofs he has given of it are toonotorious to be contradicted.”\nThat a mantruly bravewill not be guilty of perfidious, treacherousmurder, though generally true, I will admit is not absolutely conclusive; but I assert eventhatgeneral presumption ought to be admitted sufficient evidence to [repel] a charge of infamy on account of murder, which charge is totally unsupported by testimony; and the author of which, when called on for proof,shrinksfrom the undertaking.\nBut I rest not here; I have shewn that, before the year 1732, Col. Cresap was settled on the northern frontiers of Maryland, in the immediate vicinity of the Indians; every motive of personal safety and personal interest must have most forcibly influenced him to keep fair with them, and to conciliate and preserve their affection; and as, while there, he for several years had a cruel enemy in the Pennsylvania settlers, it furnished an additional motive for his avoiding every thing which might excite the resentment of the Indians. Can then evenprejudiceitself believe that on the contrary he was during that time perfidiously and wantonly murdering those Indians?\nAgain, I have shewn that in the year 1742, the executive of Maryland had in contemplation to send Col. Cresap with their commissioners to a treaty to be held with the Six Nations, and their dependencies: would that executive have even thought of promoting the interest of that province by sending to the treaty a man stained with the blood of the individuals of some of those nations, and infamous for the many murders he had committed upon them?\nConrod Wieser was anxious to prevent Colonel Cresap’s attendance. No man was better acquainted with the affairs of the Six Nations and their dependencies than Conrod Wieser. He was for a great length of time their interpreter, and possessed their confidence.\nHe was also in the confidence and interest of the government of Pennsylvania. Colonel Cresap was known to be warmly devoted to the government of Maryland, and was irritated against, and extremely obnoxious to that of Pennsylvania.\nTo this we may naturally attribute Conrod’s solicitude to prevent Colonel Cresap’s attendance at the treaty, or any other event which might be likely to give him consequence with the Six Nations.\nBut his objection to him did not arise from his having been guilty of murdering the Indians, or his being disapproved for any acts of violence inflicted upon them;—No, he trumps up as an excuse for his objection, that they were displeased with him for wanting to buy lands from their warriors—and that this was a mere pretext fabricated for the purpose I am well satisfied.\nWe have already seen that Colonel Cresap even before the year 1743, had obtained grants from the province of Maryland on the north branch of Potowmack, at Old Town. At the time when he first had in view thesecuring those lands, they were occupied by the Indians: Before he applied to the government of Maryland for a grant, he thought it prudent first to procure the approbation of the Indians in that neighborhood, and for that purpose contracted with certain of their warriors; this he did to avoid giving them offence, as at that time the line of cession between them and the province of Maryland was in dispute. And I have shewn that more that two years after, when at the treaty held at Lancaster in the year 1744–5, they ascertained that line; they so fixed it as only justtoinclude that very settlement of their brother Cresap, which he had so purchased from their warriors. This, I believe, was the purchase to which Conrad Wieser alluded; it is, I believe, the only one he had made or attempted before that time to have made from them, but which I am satisfied was not offensive to the Six Nations or any of them, or complained of by them, as I can find no trace of such complaint.\nHad Colonel Cresap before that period, been guilty of murders committed upon the Indians; had he been reputed infamous for these murders, no man would have been more likely to have known that fact than Conrod Wieser; nor can it be doubted he would have assignedthat, which would have been so much better a cause why Colonel Cresap was an improper person to accompany the Maryland commissioners to the treaty.\nI therefore infer, that at the period of 1742, Colonel Cresap was not reputed infamous for the many murders committed upon the inoffensive Indians; and that he did notthenmerit to be so reputed.\nAgain, in the year 1751 a party of indians belonging to the six nations complained to the governor of Maryland that their brother Cresap, seemed angry with them, and was not disposed to give them victuals enough; but I have examined the archives of Maryland, and can find no complaint or insinuation made by the indians of his having committed any acts of violence whatever against them or any of them.\nIs it to be presumed that the governor of Virginia should have shewn that respect for and confidence in, or that the government of Maryland should have bestowed, from the year 1739 to the year 1775, so many respectable appointments upon—a man who was infamous for the many murders he had committed, if they had known that fact; Were they not as likely to have knowledge of that fact as you were? If they were ignorant, how came you by your information?\nI have not heard that youeverpretended a belief ininspiration; you will not, I presume, insinuate you received it fromthatsource; of those murders you could not know from your own personal knowledge: If then you derive your information from any other evidence, whileI averitsfalsityIagain call on youto produce it.\nBut I proceed; between the beginning of the year 1748 and end of the year 1749, a considerable number of the most respectable gentlemen in Virginia and Maryland formed a connexion with col. Cresap to embark in important engagements for acquiring western lands, then occupied by the indians, and for carrying on an extensive trade with the indian nations: to effect either of which objects, their good will and friendship were essentially necessary. If these gentlemen had had an idea that col. Cresap had been concerned in cruel murders committed on the indians; if these gentlemen had known that he was reputed infamous on account of such murders, would not he have been the last man with whom they would have thought of entering into such a connexion?\nIn fine, from the earliest period of col. Cresap’s life, after he first settled in Maryland, ’till he ceased beingactivelyengaged in business, all his pursuits, as far as they related to his private emolument and the interest of his family, were of that nature as in a peculiar manner to require that he should be on good terms with the indians, and to excite his solicitude for their friendship.\nA further argument to prove the falsity of your charge may be drawn fromthat characterwhich you, sir, have given of the indians. You say that either education or nature “has made thepoint of honorwith the indians consist in the destruction of an enemy by stratagem, and in the preservation of his own person freed from injury;” you also say “they are as bitter and determined in their resentments, as they are sincere in their friendships, and often pursue their enemiesseveral hundred milesthrough the woods,surmounting every difficulty to be revenged”\nIf then col. Cresap had been guilty of so many murders, how came it, that there were no indians inspired with a spirit of resentment on the occasion? How came it, that all the friends and relations of these thus murdered were so entirely lost to that their “point of honor” when so few stratagems would have been requisite, and the preservation of their persons so probable? How came it, that when for so long a life he was living in their vicinity, where to have wreaked their vengeance upon him, they would have had so small a distance to go, and so few difficulties to surmount, he lived safe from that spirit of revenge; and after so very protracted an old age died in his bed?\nHow, I ask, shall all these things be accounted for, since even we, who areyet weakenough to believe in aProvidence, have never supposed theinfamous murdererto be the object ofitsparticular favour and protection!\nOne observation more I shall make to shew the falsity of the charge, and shall for that purpose here introduce a name, which by you, sir, and many of your warmest friends, I am inclined to think,will, and I amsure,oughtto be received with respect, that of the deceased col. George Mason.\nIn a letter written by him to Col. Cresap, dated the 12th of March 1783, after he had been acquainted with him near forty years, he concludes with this paragraph “Capt. B. tells me you have some thoughts of paying me a visit next summer, which gave megreat pleasure, as I can withgreat sincerityassure you there arefew men in the world, whom I should rejoicemore to seethan Col. Cresap.”\nThose, sir, who knew the late Col. George Mason, will not easily believe he would have so written to a man, who he supposed to beinfamousfor murder,—orinfamousfor any other cause.\nI here rest the defence of Col. Thomas Cresap.\nIn my next I shall proceed to examine the charges, as they relate to his youngest son, the late Michael Cresap, Esq. who, if any of the name of Cresap, werereally meantto be implicated in the charge of killing Logan’s family, was the person so meant. This I infer from my knowledge that he alone of that name was on the western side of the Alleghany mountains at the time of that event.\nI have said, “if any of that name werereally meantto be implicated,” because I have no reason to believe, that either of the name was ever thought to be concerned in the death of any individual of Logan’s family, before you wrote your notes upon Virginia.\nMy own ideas are these;—that in your controversy with the celebrated Buffon, being anxious to support the reputation of your American savage, and having some where picked up thefictitiousspeech of Logan, you thought it might be made useful;—that to increase its celebrity,you introduced into itthe name of Col. Cresap, a name well known in America, and partially in Europe;—and particularly known, as connected with the wars, which had taken place between the colonists and the indians;—and as to thestory;—that you exercised that ingenuity, which I know you to possess, toform onethat mightsuitthespeech.\nFor the entertaining and avowal of these ideas, I shall hold myself perfectly free from censure, until you shall think proper to shew them incorrect.\nI must now, sir, attend tootherduties and remain, as heretofore, withduerespect.\nYour very obedient servant.\nLutherMartin"

It bears a striking likeness of a servility to a court that ought not to have so undue an influence upon an Independant Nation. <Are we not throwing ourselves into hands and rendering ourselves subject> If ever America stood in need of wise Heads and virtuous Hearts it is at this juncture. The ship wants skilfull hands, your old sea men are chiefly retired, your Hands are new and inexperienced. Sylla is on one Side and Caribdis on the other—how will you Stear between them? In avoiding the rocks you are in danger of being swallowed up in the sands. I am greatly agitated at your movements. I see nothing but dishonour and disgrace in the union of——with——. I wish I had sooner been apprized of the design. You most assuredly have a party who do not mean the bestwelfare of their country by this movement. You or Rivington will have my mind upon the Subject before this reaches you. If the union is still undecided let me beg you to oppose it with all your influence. I wish your Friend G[err]y was with you. He is I hear unwilling to continue to beone of you.I will try persuasion upon him, and see if Female influence has any force with him.\nThree post days have passed since I received a line from you. You will see by the date of this Letter that I designed you a speedy reply to your favours but I really felt so unhappy and my mind was so intent upon consequences that I threw down my pen. I deliberated some time then took it up and wrote to our Friend G[err]y. He very obligeingly replied to me, and assured me that he would not decline a publick station whilst there was any prospect of rendering Service to his country. He informed me that by a Late Letter from Mr. L[ovell]he expected him soon in B[osto]n and that we should then be better able to judge from his information of the late measures of C[ongress]. This has been the true reason why I did not write by the two last posts as I had no inclination my Letters should fall into other Hands than those for which they were designed, but hearing nothing further I shall venture to forward this, requesting you to communicate to me the whole Fraternity to whom our Friend is joined, for what reason the comercial part of his commission is taken from him. Is it because he has enterd into no private contracts nor laid any plan for a fortune for himself and others who wish to be connected with those who will? I will tell you Sir the consequence of the late movements. If British Ships and old Neptune are not more intent upon dissapointing me than C[ongres]s I shall in the course of six months embrace my Dear Friend in his own native land. He will have no part in executing orders dishonorary to his country. One path is plain before him. He can and he will resign his commission. This his Enemies know and they will effect their purpose. I could (said he to a Friend upon an occasion not unlike the present) return to my practise at the Bar and make fortunes for my children and be happier and be really more respected than I can in the hazardous tormenting employments into which C[ongress]have always put me. I can be easy even under the marks of disgrace they put upon me, but they may depend upon it, they either mistake their own Interest in putting me into these employments, or in putting these Brands upon me—one or the other. Time Sir will determine which of these predictions are true.\n“All humane virtue to its latest Breath\nFinds envy never conquer’d but by death.”\nI hope you received all my late Letters. Yet I know not how to account for not hearing from you unless you are realy returning to your Family and Friends, and in that Number I flatter myself you will ever consider\nPortia"

They are put under cover to your Brother of Fredericksburgh, to await your arrival at that place.\nI enclose the one to your Lieutenant, Mr Lawrence Washington, for safety and because it may be necessary that you should have a conference with him respecting the plan for Recruiting your Troop, when the order, and the means for doing it, are received.\nAll however, that you, Washington & Custis have to do, at present, is simply to acknowledge the receipt of the letter from the Secretary of War; to inform him whether you do, or do not acceptthe appointment; and, in either case, to request him to thank the President for the honor he has conferred on you in making it. Perhaps, as this acknowledgement will not be as prompt as might have been expected from you & Custis (for it was supposed that both of you were to be found at Mount Vernon) it would not be amiss if you were to add, that being on an excursion into the upper Country is the cause of it. All here, as I presume you will learn from a more pleasing pen, are well. I, therefore, shall only add that I am Dear Sir Your sincere friend and affectionate Uncle\nGo: Washington"

    "content": "On Fryday June 2. 1775. Journals of Congress, page 112. The President laid before Congress a Letter from the Provincial Convention of Massachusetts Bay dated May 16. which was read, setting forth the difficulties they labour under, for want of a regular form of Government, and as they and the other Colonies are now compelled to raise an Army to defend themselves from the Butcheries and devastations of their implacable Enemies, which renders it still more necessary to have a regular established Government, requesting the Congress to favour them with explicit Advice respecting the taking up and exercising the Powers of civil Government, and declaring their readiness to submit to such a general Plan as the Congress may direct for the Colonies, or make it their great Study to establish such a form of Government there, as shall not only promote their Advantage but the Union and Interest of all America.\nThis Subject had engaged much of my Attention before I left Massachusetts, and had been frequently the Subject of Conversation between me and many of my Friends Dr. Winthrop, Dr. Cooper, Colonel Otis, the two Warrens, Major Hawley and others besides my Colleagues in Congress and lay with great Weight upon my Mind as the most difficult and dangerous Business that We had to do, (for from the Beginning I always expected We should have more difficulty and danger, in our Attempts to govern ourselves and in our Negotiations and connections with foreign Powers, than from all the Fleets and Armies of Great Britain). It lay therefore with great Weight upon my mind: and when this Letter was read, I embraced the Opportunity to open myself in Congress, and most earnestly to intreat the serious Attention of all the Members and of all the Continent to the measures which the times demanded. For my Part I thought there was great Wisdom in the Adage when the Sword is drawn throw away the Scabbard. Whether We threw it away voluntarily or not, it was useless now andwould be useless forever. The Pride of Britain, flushed with late Tryumphs and Conquests, their infinite Contempt of all the Power of America, with an insolent, arbitrary Scotch Faction with a Bute and Mansfield at their head for a Ministry, We might depend upon it, would force Us to call forth every Energy and resource of the Country, to seek the friendship of Englands Enemies, and We had no rational hope but from the Ratio Ultima Regum et Rerum publicarum. These Efforts could not be made without Government, and as I supposed no Man would think of consolidating this vast Continent under one national Government, We should probably after the Example of the Greeks, the Dutch and the Swiss, form a Confederacy of States, each of which must have a seperate Government. That the Case of Massachusetts was the most urgent, but that it could not be long before every other Colony must follow her Example. That with a View to this Subject I had looked into the Ancient and modern Confederacies for Examples: but they all appeared to me to have been huddled up in a hurry by a few Chiefs. But We had a People of more Intelligence, Curiosity and Enterprize, who must be all consulted, and We must reallize the Theories of the Wisest Writers and invite the People, to erect the whole Building with their own hands upon the broadest foundation. That this could be done only by Conventions of Representatives chosen by the People in the several Colonies, in the most exact proportions. That it was my Opinion, that Congress ought now to recommend to the People of every Colony to call such Conventions immediately and set up Governments of their own, under their own Authority: for the People were the Source of all Authority and Original of all Power. These were new, strange and terrible Doctrines, to the greatest Part of the Members, but not a very small Number heard them with apparent Pleasure, and none more than Mr. John Rutledge of South Carolina and Mr. John Sullivan of New Hampshire."

I prepared myself for a feast. I read two or three sentences: looked again at the signature to see if I had not mistaken it. It was visibly yours. Read a sentence or two more. Diable! Spelt your name distinctly. There was not a letter of it omitted. Began to read again. In fine after reading a little and examining the signature, alternately, half a dozen times, I found that your name was to four lines only instead of four pages. I thank you for the four lines however because they prove you think of me. Little indeed, but better a little than none. To shew how much I think of you I send you the inclosed letter of three sheets of paper, being a history of the evening I parted with you. But how expect you should read a letter of three mortal sheets of paper? I will tell you. Divide it into six doses of half a sheet each, and every day, when the toilette begins, take a dose, that is to say, read half a sheet. By this means it will have the only merit it’s length and dulness can aspire to, that of assisting your coëffeuse to procure you six good naps of sleep. I will even allow you twelve days to get through it, holding you rigorously to one condition only, that is, that at whatever hour you receive this, you do not break the seal of the inclosed till the next toilette. Of this injunction I require a sacred execution. I rest it on your friendship, and that in your first letter you tell me honestly whether youhave honestly performed it.—I send youthe song I promised. Bring me in return it’s subject,Jours heureux!Were I a songster I should sing it all to these words ’Dans ces lieux qu’elle tarde à se rendre’! Learn it I pray you, and sing it with feeling.—My right hand presents it’s devoirs to you, and sees with great indignation the left supplanting it in a correspondence so much valued. You will know the first moment it can resume it’s rights. The first exercise of them shall be addressed to you, as you had the first essay of it’s rival. It will yet, however, be many a day. Present my esteem to Mr. Cosway, and believe me to be yours very affectionately,\nTh:Jefferson"

With foreign Nations the commercial intercourse shod. be maintained upon principles liberal & reciprocal.

Cabell while attending the late session of the legislature, and held at the University Mar. 4. 1825.\nPresent Thomas Jefferson Rector, James Madison, George Loyall John H. Cocke, and Joseph C. Cabell.\nResolved that in consideration of the delay which attended the opening of the University beyond the day on which it had been announced, the uncertainty which this might occasion in the minds of many at what time it might be opened, and the temporary engagements which in consequence thereof they might enter into elsewhere, Notice shall be given that,for the present year, students will be recieved at the University at any time of the year when they may become disengaged, on payment of so much only of the Usual charges as shall be proportioned to the time unexpired at the date of their reception.\nA blank having been left in one of the regulations of the 4thof October last respecting the price of board in boarding houses not within the precincts of the University, resolved that it be filled with the sum of 120. Dollars.\nOn a revision of the rule of Oct. 4. last respecting testimony required from Students it was proposed to amend the same by striking out the words ‘if unwilling to give it, let the moral obligation be explained and urged, under which every one is bound to bear witness where wrong has been done, but finally let it’ and to insert instead thereof the words ‘and the obligation to give it shall’ which being agreed to, the rule as amended now stands in these words, ‘When testimony is required from a Student, it shall be voluntary, and not on oath, and the obligation to give it shall be left to his own sense of right.’\nA Resolution was moved and agreed to in the following words.\nWhereas it is the duty of this board to the government under which it lives, and especially to that of which this University is the immediate creation, to pay especial attention to the principles of government which shall be inculcated therein, and to provide that none shall be inculcated which are incompatible with those on which the Constitutions of this state, and of the US. were genuinely based, in the common opinion: and for this purpose it may be necessary to point out specifically where these principles are to be found legitimately developed:\nResolved that it is the opinion of this board that as to the general principles of liberty and the rights of man in nature and in society, the doctrines of Locke, in his ‘Essay concerning the true original extent and end of civil government,’ and of Sidney in his ‘Discourses on government,’ may be considered as those generally approved by our fellow-citizens of this, and of the US., and that on the distinctive principles of the government of our own state, and of that of the US. the best guides are to be found in 1. the Declaration of Independance, as the fundamental act of union of these states. 2. the book known by the title of ‘the Federalist,’ being an authority to which appeal is habitually made by all, and rarely declined or denied by any as evidence of the general opinion of those who framed, and of those who accepted the Constitution of the US. on questions as to it’s genuine meaning. 3. the Resolutions of the General assembly of Virginia in 1799. on the subject of the Alien and Sedition laws, which appeared to accord with the predominant sense of the people of the US. 4. the Valedictory address of President Washington, as conveying political lessons of peculiar value. and that in the branch of the school of Law, which is to treat on the subject of Civil polity, these shall be used as the text and documents of the school.\nResolved that George Tucker esquire of Lynchburg be appointed Professor of the school of Moral philosophy.\nResolved that DoctrJohn Patton Emmet of New York be appointed Professor of the school of Natural history.\nResolved that whensoever the 50,000.

Dollars.\nResolved that when the monies, expected as before mentioned from the General government, shall be paid, the board consider it advisable to employ mr Hilliard of the firm of Cummings, Hilliard and co. of Boston to purchase the library of the University, according to the Catalogue which has been made.\nResolved that the Professorship of the school of Law be proposed to Chancellor Henry StGeorge Tucker; and in the event of his refusal, then the judge Philip P.

D. which has been negociated by the Bursar of the University with the Farmer’s bank of Virginia, and the terms on which the same has been negociated, be confirmed by the board of Visitors, and the funds of the University are hereby pledged for the reimbursement of the said loan.\nA letter having been addressed to the board of Visitors by mr Bonnycastle Professor of Natural philosophy, representing that from the communications with the Agent of the Board, on the subject of his appointment, he concieved himself entitled to expect that a bond of his to the British government to the amount of £500. would be advanced: Resolved that the Rector be requested to obtain from mr Gilmer his view of the understanding which took place on the occasion; and if it should appear to the Rector, from the circumstances of the case, that the interest and credit of the University would justify and require the advance, in that event it shall be made from the funds of the Institution.\nResolved that John H. Cocke, and Jos. C. Cabell be appointed a Committee to settle the accounts of the Proctor and the Bursar of the University.\nAnd then the Board adjourned without day.\nTh: Jefferson"

The Circumstances of my Family prevent me from paying you my Respects at present: but the visit shall only be deferred till the Impediment is removed. I long, my Dear Sir, to see you: to congratulate you on the glory which you have acquired the last Campaign: and to felicitate with you on the decisive Consequences which a Victory in all Respects so brilliant, and of such vast magnitude, must produce to our Country.\nI have spent some time with our Legislature and embraced the Opportunity to inculcate, in the most cogent Terms, the necessity of strengthning your hands; so that you may be enabled to strike the Enemy before they recover from their Consternation; and tirminate the war by a vigorous Campaign. They will, I am perswaded, leave nothing unattempted to fill up their Continental Battallions, and afford some P[or]tection to our desolated Frontiers. Fully perswaded that the plan for the administration of our Afairs, on which I have hazarded my political Reputation, will be wisely conducted, and produce the most salutary Effects; I feel myself hurt that any Proposal from the Financier shoud be checked or disappointed: but his pecuniary Requisitions from this State are, I fear, far beyond the Reach of our utmost Resources. This at least is the Opinion of the most zealous Judicious, and best informed, and their Reasons appeard to be so well grounded as to preclude Sollicitation.\nIf any thing interesting from the Southward shoud transpire you will oblige me by communicating it. I put no Confidence in the Reports of a voluntary Retreat from those states; at least from Charles Town. It is my Opinion that the Enemy will rather commit that Garrison to the Chapter of Chances; than give such a palpable Proof of their weakness to all Europe. Indeed they are already too much humbled and distressed not to think seriously of patching up a Peace; but not to reckon upon the inflexible obstinacy which has all along marked the british Councils, they know too well the advantages, in a negociation, of having in their hands the Capital and Sea port of a rich State, to part with it unconstrained.\nBe pleased to present the respectful Compliments of every Branch of this Family to Mrs Washington; and to accept of their Joint wishes for your Glory and Prosperity.\nI only write in the general Voice of my Country when I assure you that I am with the most perfect Esteem and the most affectionate attachment—Dear Sir—Your Excellencys most obedient & most humble Servant\nJas Duane"

He thinks it would be useful if an officer of the U.S. in each foreign country where there is one were directed to transmit occasional state of the coins of the country, specifying standards, weights, and values, also periodical listing of market prices of gold and silver in coin and bullion, the rates of foreign exchange, and the wages of labor both in manufactures and in tillage.—He requests that, if no inconvenience in the idea appears to TJ, an instruction for this purpose be sent and copies of statements received be furnished the Treasury."

Even this alternative has its difficulties, as we greatly apprehend the impropriety of approaching you a third time on the occasion under any pretext.\nOn the first perusal of your letter, we doubted whether you contemplated it shdbe made public, with other communications we were receiving. Your remark, that “The establishment of libraries in every town is so favorable to general instruction, furnishes so salutary an employment for spare hours & inducement to pass them at home, and brings the use of books so much within the means of every one, that there cannot be two opinions on their utility” seemed so happily expressive of our design, and so well calculated to make a favorable impression on the public, that we were exceedingly solicitous to avail ourselves of its beneficial and fostering influence. But, when you continued to remark that “Of all this the public have the right and the understanding to judge for themselves, without admonitions from me, asunauthorisedasunnecessary,” after having stated, in the commencement of your letter, that you have “never permitted yourself to assume the office of recommending to the public particular books or institutions, or to advise what books they should read or what institutions establish,” we concluded, that at the same time you expressed the highest approbation of our object, the general tenour of your letter was a severe censure upon our officiousness in obtruding the subject on public attention, and therefore determined to withhold it, as its effects might be no less equivocal than your desires were, to us, uncertain.\nIt is a matter of pleasing curiosity, & indeed of admiration, to see the effort MrAdams has made, in his extreme age, to bestow on us his benediction. MrMadison, and many others of our distinguished fellow citizens have done the same; and we should be very sorry to come before the public with these names subject to so great a prejudice as the want of yours. When Jacob sent his sons into Egypt to buy corn, he retained the favorite of the family, Benjamin, at home. Joseph recognised the features of his brethren, and finding that his beloved brother Benjamin was not among them, put on a severe look, and demanded in an angry voice—“Whence came ye” &c. I fear the public will also put on a severe look, and with an angry tone, demand, “where is the favorite of the people? why has he not united with others in recommending your object.” &c So true is it, that there are instances in which neutrality is equivalent to hostility. If you will permit us to use the commendatory part of your letter, or will favor us with your sentiments expressed in any manner divested of censure, our wishes will be accomplished.—yrvery respectful & obdtServt\nRobert Mayo.\n(on the part of the[. . .])"

I well knew how watchfull the Faction would be to lie in wait & catch at every Straw, misrepresenting and abusing every measure which was intended to secure us from foreign influence. the President waited a reasonable time for the answer of the House to his Speech, before he made his nominations to the senate of envoys extraordianary to the French republick. theJacobins Seazd this interval to propogate a report that he was not Sincere in his professions to treat. when he sent in his Nominations to the senate, they were obliged to Change their ground. the next attack was upon the persons Nominated judge dana was declared to be an open & avowed Enemy to France. this opinion was propagated by Varnum & confirmd by Freeman. I tell you Names, you will however keep your informant out of sight. they however advanced this at Francis’s Hotel at the publick table at which they Dine; there are others who will transmit the same account I doubt not. the senate however confirmed the Nominations Yesterday 28 senators being present 22 voted in favour Virginna senators, Langdon Cokce of Tenassee, & two others against them. You will also see that the Nomination of JQA 19 to 9. No one ventured to utter a syllable against the person, but undertook to judge of the propriety of having a mission there.\nWe yesterday had Letters from both our sons dated in March 18 I will transcribe a passage from JQAs.\n“The french Government at present evidently design to go to War with the united states, unless the Americans will submit to sacrifice their interest their honour and their independance. to Effect this design their great expectation is founded upon the hope of our internal disunion, a hope which is very much encouraged by the Americans who are conversent with the ruling Men in France\n[“]The determination for the present is to take and perhaps to condemn all American vessels and merchandize bound to or from any Ports under the dominion of Great Britain. this system has long been discernable but is now openly avowd. upon this Principle they have already taken and condemnd several vessels going from England. the Privateers which took them have generally been fitted out byAmericans, and it is from Such Specimins that the Directory judge of the dispositions and Character of the American people.” [“]one of the objects to which this system is destined in plunder they consider the american commerce as a benificial prey, and they are desirious of a pretext to refuse the payment of about 40 millions of livers which I understand they owe to the citizens of the united stats. that they are seeking pretexts for a quarrel is plain from every circumstance that has happened Since the note of mr Adet, in october of the last year. but they gradually proceed from one step to an other because the Directory have not by the constitution the right of declaring War and they do not think the Nation or the Legislativeassembly Yet sufficiently exasperated to make a proposal to declare war for the present pass. in order to produce such an animosity they are daily useing every means of misrepresentation and falshood against the American Government. at the same time they are offering every provocation of insult indignity and injury in there power, depending either that no power exists on our part to resent them, or if they are resented that our measures will furnish them pretext for further insolence, and perhaps for proposing to the Legislature a Declaration of War.”\nYou are at Liberty to communicate this to such Friends as may be relied on.\nI inclose You Bache impudenc of this day. I say with the Member from Conneticut, I hope if the Chronical retails it, there will be found American Blood enough in Boston and American ink enough to punish him. we now have a Govenour who will give a different Tone to the sentiments of many and will aid the Federal Government. we wait for his Speech with raised expectations. I must close or the post will leave me\na kind remembrance to all Friends / from your affectionate Friend / &c &c"

    "content": "[by 7 Jan. 1817]\nMy very dear, ancient and belovd friend\nI receivedyour letter of January lastwhen I was under a paralytic stroke but not Sensible of it. I felt no acute pain, and my Sight was as usual. I could read without spectacles but could not comprehend what I read, nor itsconnextionwith what preceded or followed. I readyour letterand was pleased. I made sundry attempts to answer it but in vain, and what at last I sent asan answer, I do not now recollect.\nThe powers of my mind were weakened to such a degree that I forgot the names not only of my neighbours but even of my family and even of what I myself had said or done but a few minutes before.After this stroke fell suddenlyanother on the powers of the body (excepting the eye which still continued as usual). One night (at what distance of time from the first stroke I do not recollect) I went to bed in usual health and in the morning I found I was struck dumb. I could not utter a sound from my mouth. When I attempted to speak a strange rumbling sound seemed to come out at the ear, but not a word could I utter from the mouth. My Appetite for food now failed and allofmy bodily powers (except the eye) became weaker and weaker till the first or second week in November, at the end of the 87thand beginning of the 88 year of my Age. The beginning of my recovery was as Sudden as the strokes I had received.Onemorning being unusually refreshed with sleepI awoke as froma transe and found a wonderful change in my whole System. From that time to this I have been gradually but slowly recovering the due exercise of the powers both of mind and body except the hearing which continues dull as it was.\nI have been thus particular to apologize formy answertoyour letter, and for an Answer which I gave on the 9thof Sept to what I deemed an impertinent question of MrDelaplaine which has occasioneda very improper applicationto you. The case as far as I can now recollect was simply this—Among many other questions he asked me one which seemed to refer to the slanderous charges bandied about respecting your infidelityand disbelief of Christianity this roused my resentment and I wished to answer it by a sentence ofyour letterwhich at the instant occurred to my mind. On looking forthe letterI could not findit. But after several questions I recollected that passage ofyour letterin which you informed me that you had employed some time in composing “a wee little book which was a document in proof that you are a real Christian that is a disciple of the doctrines of Jesus Christ.” With these words I answeredhisquestion. He put several questions touching the meaning, but I answered all, with a repetition of the same words at the same[time] trying to recollect when or where I had lostthe letter. At last it occurred to me that I had been in Philadelphia and had shewn the letter to Doct Patterson, I thereupon desired MrDelaplaine to call onDoct. Patterson & enquire if I had left it there. This happened to have been the case. I had laid it on the table and forgot it; But MrD.itseems construed the favour I asked into a grant of something to himself\nAfter all this detail accept\nCharles Thomson"

    "content": "ParisNov. 18. 1788.\nDear Sir\nMy last to you was of the 31st. of July: since which I have received yours of July 24. Aug. 10. & 23. The first part of this long silence in me was occasioned by a knoledge that you were absent from N. York; the latter part, by a want of opportunity, which has been longer than usual: mr. Shippen being just arrived here, and to set out tomorrow for London, I avail myself of that channel of conveiance. Mr. Carrington was so kind as to send me the 2d. vol. of the Amer. Phil. transactions, the federalist, and some other interesting pamphlets; and I am to thank you for another copy of the federalist and the report of the instrns. to the ministers for negotiating peace. The latter unluckily omitted exactly the passage I wanted, which was what related to the navigation of the Missisipi. With respect to the Federalist, the three authors had been named to me. I read it with care, pleasure & improvement, and was satisfied there was nothing in it by one of those hands, & not a great deal by a second. It does the highest honor to the third, as being, in my opinion, the best commentary on the principles of government which ever was written. In some parts it is discoverable that the author means only to say what may be best said in defence of opinions in which he did not concur. But in general it establishes firmly the plan of government. I confess it has rectified me in several points. (As to the bill of rights however I still think it should be added, and I am glad to see that three states have at length considered the perpetual re-eligibility of the president as an article which should be amended. I should deprecate with you indeed the meeting of a new convention. I hope they will adopt the mode of amendment by Congress & the Assemblies, in which case I should not fear anydangerous innovation in the plan. But the minorities are too respectable not to be entitled to some sacrifice of opinion in the majority. Especially when a great proportion of them would be contented with a bill of rights.)\nHere things internally are going on well. The Notables now in session, have indeed past one vote which augurs ill to the rights of the people. But if they do not obtain now so much as they have a right to, they will in the long run. The misfortune is that they are not yet ripe for receiving the blessings to which they are entitled. I doubt, for instance, whether the body of the nation, if they could be consulted, would accept of a Habeas corpus law, if offered them by the king. If the Etats generaux, when they assemble, do not aim at too much, they may begin a good constitution. There are three articles which they may easily obtain. 1. their own meeting periodically. 2. the exclusive right of taxation. 3. the right of registering laws & proposing amendments to them as exercised now by the parliaments. This last would be readily approved by the court on account of their hostility against the parliaments, & would lead immediately to the origination of laws. The 2d. has been alreadily [sic] solemnly avowed by the king: & it is well understood there would be no opposition to the first. If they push at much more, all may fail. I shall not enter further into public details, because my letter to mr. Jay will give them. That contains a request of permission to return to America the next spring, for the summer only. The reasons therein urged, drawn from my private affairs are very cogent. But there is another more cogent on my mind, tho’ of a nature not to be explained in a public letter. It is the necessity of attending my daughters myself to their own country, and depositing them safely in the hands of those with whom I can safely leave them. I have deferred this request as long as circumstances would permit, and am in hopes it will meet with no difficulty. I have had too many proofs of your friendship not to rely on your patronage of it, as, in all probability, nothing can suffer by a short absence. But theimmediatepermission is what I am anxious about; as by going in April & returning in October I shall be sure of pleasant & short passages out & in. I must intreat your attention, my friend, to this matter, and that the answers may be sent me thro’ several channels.\nMr. Limozin at Havre, sent you by mistake a package belonging to somebody else. I do not know what it contained, but he has written to you on the subject, & prayed me to do the same. He is likely to suffer if it be not returned.\nSupposing that the funding their foreign debt will be among the firstoperations of the new government, I send you two estimates, the one by myself, the other by a gentleman infinitely better acquainted with the subject, shewing what fund will suffice to discharge the principal and interest as it shall become due, aided by occasional loans, which the same fund will repay. I inclose them to you, because collating them together, and with your own ideas, you will be able to devise something better than either. But something must be done. This government will expect, I fancy, a very satisfactory provision for the paiment of their debt, from the first session of the new Congress. Perhaps in this matter, as well as the arrangement of your foreign affairs, I may be able, when on the spot with you, to give some information & suggest some hints, which may render my visit to my native country not altogether useless. I consider as no small advantage the resuming the tone of mind of my constituents, which is lost by long absence, and can only be recovered by mixing with them: and shall particularly hope for much profit & pleasure, by contriving to pass as much time as possible with you. Should you have a trip to Virginia in contemplation for that year, I hope you will time it so as that we may be there together. I will camp you at Monticello where, if illy entertained otherwise, you shall not want that of books. In firm hope of a happy meeting with you in the spring or early in summer I conclude with assurances of the sincere esteem & attachment with which I am, Dear sir, your affectionate friend & servt.\nTh: Jefferson\nP. S. The inclosed letters are extremely interesting to me, and recommended to your friendly and particular care."

It is well understood that the permanent forms cannot in the present state of the Regiment be exactly complied with. But it will be with reason expected at the public offices that they shall be approached as nearly as possible. This has not been done. I have personally explained to Lt. Smith Pay Master how it may be done. Any officer of a company may represent his Captain & the Regimental Pay Master by special order of the Commandant may act for those Companies which have no officers present. It is at least essential that the names as well as the numbers of officers and men should appear.\nIf the Officers are already discouraged by the difficulties they have experienced—it is an unlucky presage of what may be expected inrelation to the far greater difficulties incident to their military career. It is hoped for their reputation that you have expressed yourself too strongly. As far as their complaints respect the delay of pay, it is to be ascribed to the want of proper documents from the Regiment. This observation is not intended as censure; for it is not doubted that the best intentions have existed and that any defect in this particular which may exist has arisen from misapprehension of what might and could be done. But circumstances like these ought to inspire a spirit of accommodation.\nWith regard to platters &c the public stores when they were called for by me were found empty, because it had not been the practice to furnish them. It is known to the Officers who served regimentally during our revolution war, that these articles were seldom supplied, and that various contrivances were made for substitutes. And I am told that the furnishing of such articles has been for a long time discontinued. When furnished, in the course of active operations they are very apt to be lost or destroyed and then they are of necessity dispensed with.\nI mention these things to shew that these articles are not deemed indispensable and that a delay in obtaining them ought to be met with good humour. It has not been usual in our service to furnish Marquees to any officer of a grade below the commandant of a Regiment. This explains that point.\nYou will not I trust misconceive me. I am not displeased with your giving me the information which is contained in your letter. It is right I should know the discontents which prevail whether well or ill founded, proportionate or exaggerated. But it is also right and necessary that I should frankly disclose the impression I have of them.\nI shall only add that it is essential to cultivate a spirit of accommodation and that it is expected that every officer will in his station do so as a duty of the first importance.\nWith great consideration & esteem I am Sir Yr Obed ser\nMajor Wilcocks"

It is long since I have written to you, but much longer since I have had the honor of hearing from you, and I am perfectly satisfied that both these effects have been produced by causes not fairly within our controul—perhaps the same obstructions may not so fully prevail hereafter, and if they do not, I shall be happy—\nWhilst I congratulate you on being appointed sole Minister to so eminent a Court as that of London, I cannot help congratulating my Country at the same time, for the just expectations that may be formed from the wisdom, patriotism, and diligence of its Minister— The untoward circumstances in which both countries are found [to] be placed, may have arisen from a neglect of decent and proper respect having been heretofore paid by each to the other— And if so,this advance on our part, may lead to the establishment of better conduct and happier consequences. That it may be so, may God, of his infinite mercy, grant— So far, I think that I pray devoutly for the honorable success of your Mission— Colo.Smith can give you so accurate a state of things here that it seems not necessary for me to enlarge on them—but with respect to this Gentleman, and his appointment, permit me to observe, that his established reputation is that of a Man of honor, of sense, and of very tried attachments to the success of our Union. His appointment (I mean the Office) Seems, as far as I have been able to investigate it, from a wish to shew respect to the Court of London, by an exact observance of all forms in such cases practised—\nI believe that Congress will adjourn (leaving a Committee of the States) in June next— So that when you find leisure and inclination to honor me with a letter, by sending it to the house of Wallace Johnson & Muir, my Correspondents in the City of London, they will forward your letter safely to me.\nI heartily wish you every honor and success in life that you can wish yourself\nYour affectionate friend\nRichard Henry Lee"

    "content": "Morris Town [N.J.] 28th November 1780\nDear Sir\nI gave directions to Generals Glover—Patterson and Huntington to discharge the Levies of Connecticut and Massachusetts, by degrees, upon their arrival at their places of cantonment, beginning with those first who were worst clad and otherwise unfit for service, as this would diminish our numbers insensibly, and not give the enemy an opportunity of knowing the truth before the time which they naturally count upon. You will be pleased to direct the same to be done with those of New Hampshire, and consult with Genl Knox upon the propriety of dismissing those attached to the Artillery also, for I find we shall have occasion to divest ourselves of every mouth that we can possibly do without, and have difficulty enough to subsist afterwards.\nTo give more perfect security to the Northern and Western Frontier and to keep the York line as much as possible together, that they may have the better opportunity of compleating their new arrangement, I have determined to send the remainder of the York Brigade to Albany, to be stationed there and at Schenectady and else where as Genl Clinton shall direct. You will therefore put them in Motion, by water, if the Weather will permit, and give Genl Clinton notice of their coming, that he may endeavour to make preparation and provision for them—You will let the commanding Officers know my motives, and at the same time inform them that their being brought down from Albany, a little time ago, was owing to the sudden contradiction of the false alarm,which did not give me time to send orders for their stay, as I then intended.\nThe Regimental Cloathiers of each had best remain below, to receive their respective proportions, which I will have delivered upon my arrival at New Windsor. I expect that will be in three or four days, or perhaps a little longer, as I have some arrangements to make here.\nYou will divest yourself as speedily as possible of all the superfluous Horses of the Connecticut and Massachusetts lines, as I imagine you have long since done of those of the others. I am Dear Sir Yr most o[b]t Servt\nGo: Washington"

I have inform’d you by the brig Telemachus of the situation of the Squadron & as I have not heard from Comodore Preble since I presume he is off Tripoli with six gun boats & two bombards which I am in hopes will enable him to conclude an honorable peace.\n“On receipt of yours of the 26th. of December I made every effort in my power to procure a passage home immediately, but without effect; it is now too late, I amconsequently subjected to considerable expence & a winters passage, which however disagreeable shall not prevent me from presenting myself at the seat of government in December or January: while I remain here it would give me pleasure to render the public every service in my power.”"

Nevertheless, I pray you to desire Mr Young to get his Oats ready without delay as the Vessel will not, indeed ought not to be detained a moment longer on her passage, than is indispensably necessary to transport the Oats & other things across, which will be done at one trip if waggons can be hired. To this end mynephew (if the letter reaches him) is instructed. If this Vessel should not stop, another shall be sent to Potomac creek—it will be proper therefore that no time should be lost in preparing the Oats.\nFor the different kinds of seeds, you have promised me of your own growth, I pray you to accept my thanks. I shall be attentive to make the most of them—& shall be obliged to you for letting me know whether the Barley, or bear (as your farmer calls it) is a Spring or Winter grain; & at what time it ought to be sown. Your bunch-bean accounts for the mistake of asking for bunch peas. George led me into it, for I had never heard of them before. The Beans must be valuable, & I shall esteem them an acquisition. When ought they to be planted? Is your field pea subject to the bug, as the garden peas are? How did your field beans turn out? If you have any of these to spare I would thank you for some. They are (if of the proper sort) highly esteemed in the present husbandry of England as a preparatory crop for wheat.\nMrs Washington & Fanny join me in offering every good wish for you, my niece & the family; & with sentiments of great regard & affection, I am Dear Sir, &c.\nG: Washington"

The last packet I sent was by a waggon returning to your neighbourhood which brought me a letter from Mr. W. Maury; By which I sent at the same time a small supply of Bark for my Mother.\nI mentioned to you in one of my former letters that I had a prospect of getting on very favorable terms a few scarce books from a library brought hither for sale by Col. Zane. My purchases of him have amounted in the whole to Nineteen pounds three shillings of this currency. As I had not the money here for him, & he could not conveniently wait till it would be convenient for me to pay him, I was obliged to give him a draught on you. I hope you will be able to find means tosatisfy it.

Unless liberal principles prevail on the occasion, I shall be under the necessity of selling a negro\nI have not time to provide for this opportunity the information relative to the Copper plates.\nThe newspapers give you in general the intelligence we have from Europe. As far as we are enabled to Judge of the views of the British Cabinet, the misfortunes of one more campaign at least will be necessary to conquer their obstinacy. They are attempting a separate peace with the Dutch & talk of suspending their offensive war agst. us, & directing their whole resources agst. the naval power of France & Spain. If this be their real plan we may be sure they do not mean by it to abandon their pretensions to the U. States but try another mode for recovering them. During their offensive exertions agst. our Ally, they can be practising insidious ones agst. us: and if in the first they should be successful, & in the latter disappointed, a renewal of a vigorous war upon us will certainly take place. The best security agst. every artifice & every event will be such military preparations on our part as will be sufficient either to resist or expell them as the case may require.\nWith my affectionate regards for the family I am Kind Sir Yr. dutiful son\nJ.

For you, Is my fondest wish, my ardent Prayer. And you judged rightly, when you informed me of your late appointment, to believe, I should sincerely rejoice in any circumstance which might afford you a decent support, & add to your comfort & respectability—But for this unsought & unexpected favour, you must look with gratitude tohim, who has graciously said, “I will be a God to you, & to your Children”—The prayers offered, & the Blessing implored by your pious Ancestors, you perhaps, now are experiencing there Efficacy; for ever since you came into life my Son, you have been highly favoured—This ought certainly to fill your whole Soul with gratitude to heaven, & benevolence to man; with an ardent desire to honourHim, from whom cometh the [“]most perfect Gifts”—by cheerfully performing with Zeal & fidelity the duties of your Station. Whoever sustains a public office, is a Servant of the people, & responsible for its just, & equitable performance—I think you have too much ambition, goodness, & sensibility of heart, not to be apprised, & fully <apprized> impressed with the necessity ofmethod& regularity in business, that a prompt, & very punctual discharge be evident, honourable, convenient & profitable to yourself, & greatly satisfactory to the public—To those in office, or in a professional line, the confidence of the people is essential—And, bad as the world is, to obtain this, no sacrifice of truth, honour or justice is requisite, but to exell in these Virtues, is the best mean to obtain their[esteem]& Suffrages—the approbation of the worthy of each Sex—You I trust, have hitherto escaped the snares of female seduction, & your mind is uncontaminated by scenes of Vice—But neither the plaudits of the world, the Emoluments of buisiness, nor the splendor of Riches, will avail but little in the scale of happiness, unless you can find avirtuous woman—whose mental powers will enliven the domestic circle, whose sweetness of disposition will meliorate Evils; & with sentiments congenial to your own, heighten the pleasures of Life—\n“Oh bless’d with temper, whose unclouded ray,\nCan make tomorrow, cheerful as to day.[”]\nWhenever you have obtained an “elegant sufficiency,” I hope my Son, you will make choice, (& not till then,) of such an One for your Partner <of>—You, who neednot roamfor sights of connubial bliss, will not want any further incentive—happy that you can count so many within the circle of your acquaintance—But a Mothers heart often recoils, I fear—I tremble, for you my dear Son, when I consider how many virtues are requisite to form an happy union—a connection which nothing less dreadful than Death, is able to dissolve—\nWhat sagacity & prudence, what caution, & close examination is necessary, before the dye is cast, upon which depends the whole coulour of your future Life—When I daily see the disguise, the duplicity which is practiced, & thenegationof principle, of sincerity which prevails, I know not how you can come at a just estimate, & can only advise in general terms—to becautious,deliberate, &circumspect—For notwithstanding unforeseen contingencies often determine our fate, yet, let Virtue, Knowledge, Industry Oeconomy,filialaffection, or obedience, be viewed as things indespensable, as of the utmost importance in the Character, while youth, beauty, & fortune are but secondary objects—\nYour Lot has fallen amongsomeof theloveliest of Women, & you must have imbibed the most exalted Idea of female excellence—By a nearer alliance may it not be lessened, but increase in a tenfold Ratio—If I am not deceived, your heart is susceptive <of some> of the best affections—You have hitherto viewed the nuptial state, as a beautiful Landscape, whose original, perhaps, you might, never reach. You have stood upon the “mount, & with ardent eye, viewed the fair Perspective, but never have been permitted to possess the happy Land—or taste the Fruit of Eden—For, believe me my Son, there is no state in life, so productive of genuine happiness, as that which was Instituted by the Lord of life, & sanctioned by his lovely presence—\nI have been led insensibly into this train of thought—Perhaps you may think my advice premature, or unnecessary, but when I consider how much depends upon your marriage, & your previous conduct I cannot believe my suggestions too early. For, whenever your business is sufficient to support a Family, I hope you will make no delay, to make a wise choice, & find that rich blessings “are twisted with your Bands”—But, unless you my Son, essentially alter in some of your Habits, for it is always, comely, & frugal to beNeat, Ishall pitythe Woman—\nAs I seldom say anything upon political affairs, you, perhaps, may think my letter very uninteresting; but when we consider the fatal effects of ungoverned Passions—virulence & party Spirit, in the recent Instance of Silfredge, & the unfortunate Austin, we cannot be too much guarded against malice, evil speaking, & unbridled Anger which is too often excited by Politicks—We may assert things in the form of a Question, stand upon safe ground, & quit the field with honour, but it never helps even a good cause to be positive—overbearing—& voilent—\nI hope you have been attentive to your Sister, since she has been near you—She is every way worthy of your notice & fraternal affection\nSend home by her, any work, you may want done, & do not forget that you have a Mother ever solicitous for the welfare of her Son—May he experience the smiles of heaven, is the fervent petition, of\nElizabeth Peabody—"

The same time many trifleing affairs it will be our policy to overlook as long as we want Barbary friendship or That Their System exists on its present Plan.\nOf The over acts of this Govt. and That of Tunis and Tripoli you must on Many Occasions Consider, That it is Something extraordinary, That it is admitted of by The great powers, but you will perceive by The late publication of french State papers what was intended as a Reform in The system of Barbary, by the British and french: it is a loss to humanity and Commerce That This reform did not take place before The present Rupture happened.\nOn the 28th. ult. I informed the Minister of Marine and forign affairs That The Govt. of The U States would Send The Stores, except The powder, That The President had acquised to The deys Objections finding Them raisonable relative to The late appointed Consul and would Appoint Another. He asked me why The powder would not be Sent I answered The other Articles were first Commisoned for or required and it was Customary to send those articles first. Another Consideration That I would wish to impress on his Mind was That we scarcely made any powder or Cables in The U Sts. that powder and hemp we were obliged to Send to The Baltic for Those Articles. We agreed it would be better not to say anything to The dey on the Subject of powder He asked me if The Govt. did not Ansr. The deys letter I ansd. That I belived when The one I recd. was wrote, which was 4 Months past, that at that time the deys letter had not Arrived in America, but That if it would Arrive I belived it would be Answered by The arrival here of The Expected Consul. Well, Says he when is The Vessel with Stores to arrive. I ansd. I could not say for Certainty but would expect to See her in The Run of 30—or 40 days.\nYou will have learnt, that The deans on the 28th. of April had arranged the difficulties threats or exactions of the dey for the Sum of in money and Stores to The Amount of 80 Thsd. $, & That in April allso This Regency under a pretence ordered away The British Consul Mr. falcon.\nThe 9th of June finished the 1st. Cruise this year of This famous marine They in all Captured large and small 15 sail of Christian Vessels crews amounting to 195 is made slaves of. Amongst This number is 5 Sail of British & Maltese Vessels, Crews of 75 Persons, allso a Crew of the 7 Island Republic, and Roman and neapolitan fishermen and Coasters.\nThe Portugee Ship of war the Vasco da Gama of 74 Guns, on the morning of the 2d. of June Captured one of The deys Corsairs a Xebec of 24 Guns and 140 men with 14 Christians on board, but had he done his duty, he might at least have Captured 3 more.\nAt Alicante, I am informed there is a portugee Ship of war and 2 frigates with an ambasador, whom has wrote to The dey & Jew directory for Permision to Come to Algiers. It is granted. He is to be recommended to The good offices of The Spanish Consul. Here is in all 380 portugeese at 2 Thsd. $. each is 760 Thsd. with a duty of 15 perCt on the ransom of Captives, will amount to 874 Thsd. $ that is supposeing The dey Can be prevailed on to let Them go officers and mariners at That price or average. He will do it, under The Consideration of getting the Crew of his Corsair Gratis. Then Sir There will be besides Grand doucers—and should his mission extend to a peace it will be at least to The amount of Sir a million of dollars but I doubt if he Can Succeed on the peace. It is The interest of Spain and other powers to oppose it and keep the portugees at war with The States of Barbary particularly with Algiers.\nIf the Portugee Ship had not Captured The algerine Corsairs The ransom would be increased on account of The portugee officers at least 25 pr. Ct. as The dey is led to belive They are all Sons of great men.\nI belive That Spain is to ransom 75. of The Crew of a portugee Brig of war Captured by The algerines in The Summer of 1800 from under The Batteries of Barcelonia.\nBy The Purporte of your letter I should have done Something to Communicate to The dey, and Jews, but as I See The Consequence That might unjustly result, on account of The approach of The portugee Mission, bringing Such Sums of money and presents, to The dey and aids, untill That the Vessel with Stores Might arrive and allso That I hear of the approach of The expected frigates &c. by That time we shall see how far The portugee mission will Succeed. I should be sorrow to take their Station and they ours even as bad as it is as to humiliation, and I further Consider That when The Govt. of Portugal determined to Send Said Mission The affairs of Europe had a different prospect to what They have at present, That in Consequence Such a Sum of Money as will be requisite to effect or Carry The algerines affairs will be more immediately wanted by The Govt. of portugal in their present Situation. It will be difficult at Lisboa to Content on all tacks The Views or desire of Bonapart.\nThe Corsairs as yet remains all in port, untill That The business of portugal is determined on one tack or The other, and That This Govt. will perceive what Course The British will Steer relative to The Potent Dey. As it is reported The British intends takeing possesion of Socilia and to hold Malta, and That france has or will take possesion of Livorn Genoa and naples, This destroys The deys banks of newfoundland The algerines will not respect those places under British or french protections except They give the dey a Consideration or make with him a Convention to That purport.\nIt is to be hoped The algerines ordering away with Such indignity The British Consul and Captureing and Enslaveing The Malteese will bring forward Something Serious as I understand That Lord Nelson is much exasperated on those Events. But Sir hitherto The British Govt. has acquiesed to All The insults of Algiers &c.\nI have Known three great Events in The UStates, our independance The forming and Carrying into Effect The present Constitution and The all important affair of Annexing Luissanna to The Union of The UStates. Sir, I am Very respectfully Your Most Obt. Humble Servt.\nRichd. OBrien"

    "content": "Paris April 19. 1780\nSir\nA Pamphlet has been published, in England, under the Title of “a memorial to the Sovereigns of Europe, on the present State of Affairs, between the old and new World.” It is Said to have been written by Governor Pownal, and, after an Acquaintance with his style, for more than twenty Years, I find So many quaint Words, and unintelligible Expressions, intermixed with so much Knowledge of America, and So many good Thoughts, which are all Characteristic, that I have no doubt, it is his. I will endeavor to give Congress an Account of it.\nHe begins with observing, very justly, that at the End of the last War, a new system was formed, both political and commercial, which is now, compleatly formed, that the Spirit of Commerce has become a leading Power, that at that Time the Center of this system was G. Britain, whose Government, might if it had been wise have preserved, the Advantage of being the Center, both of the Commerce and Politicks of the World: but being unwise they disturbed the Course of things, and have not only lost forever that Dominion which they had and might have held, but the external parts of the Empire are one after another falling off, and it will be once more reduced to its Insular Existence.\nOn the other hand, this new System of Power, moving round its own proper Center, which is the new World has dissolved, all the forces sent against it by the English, and has formed natural Connections with France and Spain, and other Countries. Founded in nature it is growing, by accellerated motions, into a great and powerful Empire. It has taken its equal station, among the nations of the Earth. Video Solem orientem in Occidente. N. America is a new primary Planet, which taking its Course in its own orbit, must have an Effect upon the orbit of every other, and shift the common Center\nof Gravity of the whole system of the European World. She is de facto, an independant Power, and must be so, de Jure. The Politicians of Europe may reason or negotiate: the Powers of Europe may fight about it: but such Negotiations and Wars will have no Consequence on the right or the fact. It would be just as wise to fight or negotiate for the dominion of the moon, which has been long common to them all, and all may profit of her reflected light. The Independance of America is as fixed as fate: She is mistress of her own fortune, knows that she is so, and will manage that Power which she feels herself possessd of, to establish her own System and change that of Europe. Thus far I think Gov. Pownal Speaks like an oracle—he proceeds.\nIf the Powers of Europe, will see the state of Things, and act accordingly, the lives of thousands may be spared, the Happiness of millions secured, and the peace of the World preservd. If not, they will be plunged into a sea of Blood. The War, which is almost gorged between Britain and America, will extend itself to all the maritime Powers, and most probably afterwards to all the Inland Powers, and like the 30 years war, of the 16 and 17th Centuries, will not end, but by a general Resettlement of Interests, according to the Spirit of the new system which has taken Place. Why may not all this be done by a Congress of all Nations, before, as well as after the War?\nLet me observe here to Congress, as I go along, that G. Pownal in this Paragraph, seems to be in that profound state of Ignorance, which all his Nation is manifestly in, of what is passing in the rest of the World. He seems to think that the maritime Powers will be divided upon the American Question, and go to War about it, whereas it is very certain that all the other maritime Powers, are unanimous about, in favour of one side, against England, and I cant think that he supposes England can maintain the 30 years War, against all the maritime Powers—G. Pownal proceeds.\nThe final settlement of Power, at a Peace, is never in proportion to the success of Arms. It depends upon the Interposition of Parties, who have not meddled in the War, but who come to the treaty for Peace, brought forward by Intrigue, with the Aid of Jealousy, and counteract, by negotiation the envied Effects of Arms.\nThe Britons have forced, the present system, into Establishment before its natural Season. They might have Secured the Attachment of their Plantations for years to come, as Spain by her caution will do: but it was a principal part of the plan, of the confidential Counsellors, in a general Reformation of the Kings Government, to reform the Constitutions of America. They were informed it would lead toWar, but they thought it would be a good measure to force the Americans to arms. Conquest, of which they were sure, would give them the Right of giving what Constitutions they thought fit, such as that to Quebec—little foreseeing what a War, it would prove, and still less suspecting, that France and Spain, and all the rest of the World, would interpose.\nNone of the Powers of Europe, and few of the most knowing Politicians, have considered, what Effect this Revolution will have on the general system of Europe. Here I believe Govr. Pownal is mistaken. Every Power in Europe, and every Politician in Europe, except those in G. Britain have digested this subject very well. The Govr. goes on. One thing is certain, that on whatever ground the War between Britain and Bourbon began, in whatever course it may take, however long they may continue it, to their mutual destruction, the Americans will never belong to either foedere inequale. Here I hope and trust in God Gover. Pownals Judgement is infallible. He goes on. The Powers of Europe, who will become Parties, before these affairs come to the Issue, will concur in no other settlement, than that these states are an independant sovereign Power, holding a free Commerce equally with all.\nIn order [to] shew, how these matters may, and finally will be settled, he proposes to lay before the Sovereigns, a View of the European and American Worlds; and point out what will be the natural Effects of the Seperation of them, and of the Independance of America, upon the commercial and political state of Europe, and finally to shew how the present Crisis, may by Wisdom and Benevolence, [be] wrought into the greatest Blessing of Peace, Liberty and Happiness, which the World hath yet seen.\nHe professes that he can look to the one and the other of these Worlds, with the same Philosophic Indifference, with which an Astronomer compares the Magnitude and Distances of Planets, free from all Habits, and Prejudices, that possess the Europeans.\nHe then proceeds to compare, the new and old World, in point of Magnitude, Spirit, and Power. He says that in measuring, the Magnitude of states too much is ascribed commonly, Extent of Territory, and fruitfulness of Soil.\nThat Extent of Dominion, which is most capable, of a Systematical Connection and Communication, has the most natural Greatness.\nThe three other Parts of the World, are naturally seperated from each other, and altho once under the dominion of the Romans, as this was an unnatural Exertion, beyond the Resources of humannature it soon dissolved, and they seperated. Europe Asia and Africa, are not only seperated by their local Positions, but are inhabited by distinct Species of human Beings. North and south America, are in like manner naturally divided. North America, is possessed by Englishmen, and this natural Circumstance forms this division of America, into one great Society, the Basis of a great dominion. There is no where in Europe, So great and combined an Interest, communicating through so large a territory, as that in north America. The northern and southern Parts of Europe, are possessed by different nations, actuated by different Sovereignties and systems. Their Intercourse is interrupted, they are at perpetual Variance, Intercourse is difficult over Land, and by Sea. They are cutt off by intervening nations. On the Contrary, when N. America is examined, you find every thing united in it, which forms Greatness. The nature of the Coast and the Winds, renders Communication by navigation perpetual. The Rivers, open an inland navigation, which carries on a Circulation through the whole. The Country thus united, and one part of it, communicating with another, by its Extent of Territory and Variety of Climates, produces, all that nature requires, that Luxury loves, or that Power can employ. All these Things, which the Nations of Europe under every difficulty that a defect of natural Communication, under every obstruction that a perverse artificial System throws in their Way, barter for, are in N. America possessed, with an uninterrupted natural Communication and an unobstructed navigation, and an universal freedom of Commerce by one nation. The naval stores, Timber, Hemp, Fisheries, Salt Provisions of the north. The Tobacco, Rice, Cotton, silk, indigo, fruits and perhaps Wines, Resin and Tar of the South, form a reciprocation of Wants and supplies. The Corn, flour, Manufactures &c. of the middle states, fill up the Communion and compleat its system. They unite those Parts which were before connected, and organize the several parts into one whole.\nThe Islands, are no doubt, naturally Parts of this North American Communion. The European Powers, may by Effects of Force, if they can agree, preserve the Property and Dominion of those Islands, for some years, perhaps an Age. But if they quarrell, about them, the whole of the Spanish, Dutch, Danish, French and British Islands, bound in Union, with North America, must become Parts of her system.\nAltho no Symptoms of Revolution at present appear in South America, yet it may be proper to inquire into those internal Circum­stances of its natural and political system, by which it works to Independancy.\nS. America is larger than North, and has more Variety of Climates, and further advanced to a natural Independance of Europe, and is growing into the largest Amplitude of Dominion that this Earth has ever yet Seen. Agriculture, has already produced, here not only an Abundance for home Consumption, but a surplus for Exportation. The Articles of Export, are Wheat, flour, barley, Wine, hemp, tallow, lard, Sugar, Cocoa, fruits, Sweetmeats, pickles, naptha, oil, cotton &c. This Progress of Agriculture has produced Manufactures and Trade. Cordage, Sail cloth of Cotton, Woolen and linnen cloth, hats, Leather, fiance, Instruments of husbandry, tools of Mechanicks &c. As the Population and Culture of Chili, shall increase, the produce of these higher Latitudes and cooler Climates, will enter into the great system, and will compleat the western Side of S. America, possessed by one nation into an object of as much greater magnitude of Wealth and Power, than the English nation possesses in N. America, as it is greater in the Variety and extent of its internal Communication, besides which it will have an uninterrupted Intercourse of East Indian Commerce. N. America has not as yet gone into an active State of manufactures, nor will it for many Years, yet N. America, is more independant in the Spirit of its People, and in Policy. It has only first Seperated from the old World. S. A. is not yet ripe for falling off, nor is it likely to be forced to a premature Revolt, as N. A. has been. As Long as the Ct. of S[pain]proceeds with the Temper, Address, and Wisdom, which it observes at present, an indolent, luxurious, and Superstitious People, not much accustomed to think of Politicks (tho much more than is generally suspected) will continue in subjection to Government, and commercial Restrictions. But the Natives increasing, beyond any proportion to the N[umber]of old Spaniards; having the executive Power, of all the inferiour Magistracies in their own hands, by their own Election of the magistrates, they have the Power of internal Government in their own hands, and the Government of the sovereign, by his Viceroys, Audiences, Clergy, Army &c., is a meer tenure at good Will. A great Country like this, so advanced in Agriculture, Manufactures, Arts and Commerce, is too large for any Government in Europe to manage by Authority, 4 or 5 thousand miles off. Bacon says, “there are two manners of Securing large territories: the one by the natural arms of every Province; and the other by the protecting arms of the principal State, in which later case commonly the provincials are disarmed. There are two dangersincident to every State, foreign Invasion and inward Rebellion. These two Remedies of state, fall into these two dangers in case of remote provinces, for if such a state rest upon the natural Arms of the Province, it is sure to be subject to Rebellion, or Revolt: if upon protecting Arms it is sure to be weak against Invasion.” Spain as well as England found themselves under the necessity of repealing a Revenue Law which they had made, because they felt that they could not carry it into Execution, by Authority. The disputes between Spain and Portugal, about the Boundaries of the Brazils and the Spanish Provinces, arose from their not being able jointly, to carry into Effect a Pacification. S. America is growing too much for Spain to manage. It has Power to be independent and will be so in fact, when any Occasion shall arise. It will not be after the Manner of N. America, which has become a democratick or Aristocratic Republic. S. A. will be conducted by some injured and enterprizing Genius to Monarchy.\nHe proceeds to consider, what he calls, from Ld. Bacon, the Amplitude and Growth of State in North America, and Says that Civilization, next to Union of System and Communication of Parts, constitute it. He compares the Civilization of America with that of Europe, and if I understand him, for he is almost unintelligible, his Conclusion, is true, and just (whatever, Smaller men than he may think of it) that the Civilization of North America is, Superior to that of Europe. When I say that this Conclusion is just I dont mean, that Architecture, Painting, Statuary, Poetry, in one Word the fine Arts, are so well understood, nor that the Mechanick Arts are so well understood and practised by any Individuals in America as they are by some in Europe, nor do I mean that the sciences those of Government and Policy particularly are so learnedly understood by any Individuals in America, as they are by some in Europe: by I mean and I say this, that Arts, sciences, Agriculture, Manufactures, Government, Policy, Commerce are better understood, by the collective Body of the People in America, than they are by that of Europe. And this is the only Way of stating the Comparison of Civilization, and in this Respect America is infinitely further removed from Barbarity than Europe.\nGovernor Pownal proceeds. When the Spirit of Civilization began first in Europe, after the Barbarous Ages of the northern Invaders, the Clergy, were the blind leaders to light, and the feudal Lords, the Patrons of Liberty—what Knowledge! what Liberty!—the Instruction of the first, was more pernicious than Ignorance: the Patronage ofthe last was the Benevolence of a Grazier, who fattens his Cattle, to profit of their Hides, and Bodies. The People held their Knowledge, as they did their Lands by a servile Tenure, which did not permit them to use it as their own. Such was theSourceof Civilization in Europe!\nThe first movement of Civilization, is the application of Labour to the Culture of the Earth, in order to raise that supply of Food which is necessary for Men in society. The Application of Labour to Architecture, Cloathing, Tools and Instruments is concommitant with this. Marketts, in which a Reciprocation of Wants and surplusses, is accomplished, succeeds. Hence arise, by a further Improvement Artificers and Manufacturers. And in succession a surplus is created beyond what is wanted by the Individuals, or the Community, which produces Commerce, by exchanging this surplus for articles of Conveniency, or Enjoyment, which the Country does not produce.\nBy the Violence of the military Spirit, under which Europe was a second time Peopled, the Inhabitants were divided into two Classes, Warriors and slaves. Agriculture was conducted by the latter, Wretches annexed to, not owners of the Soil, degraded Animals! Cattle, Property, not Proprietors! no Interest in their own Reasons, Labour, Time. They had neither Knowledge, nor Motive to make one Effort of Improvement. Improvement in Agriculture, was therefore, many hundred years at a Stand. Although in some Countries of Europe it may seem at present progressive, it is so slow that for Ages it can have no great Effect, except perhaps in England, yet even here the farmer, is absurdly and cruelly oppressed.\nManufactures, or the Labour of Men in Wool, Iron, Stone, or Leather, were held as the servile offices of Society, and fit only for slaves. These Artificers, were mere Machines of the most arrogant and ignorant Master. They would never make Experiments. So that Mechanicks and Arts, went on for Ages without Improvement.\nUpon the dissolution of the Hanseatic League, the Sovereigns who had seen the Power, which arose from Manufactures and Trade, began to encourage their subjects and invite Strangers, to establish them. Civilization took a momentary start. But the Policy of the Sovereigns, held the Manufacturers, in wretched Condition, by many obstructing Regulations. The Same Policy, affecting to encourage Manufactures, gave them a false help, by setting assises in the produce of Land, which oppressed Agriculture. This Same system of Policy, confined Ingenuity, by making imposing Regulations and taxes on every Motion of Manufactures, on their coming from the Handof the Workman: on the Carriage: on the sale: on the Return whether in goods or Money. This Policy, was directed to draw into the Treasury of the state, all the Profit, beyond the Labourers subsistance. Commercial Legislation, was directed wholly, to make the subject sell but not buy: export Articles but import Money, of which the state must have the greatest share. Hence exclusive Property of certain Materials of Manufacture, which they called Staple Commodities—hence Monopolies—exclusive Priviledges of trade, to Persons, Articles and Places: exclusive Fisheries:—hence the notions of the ballance of Trade:—and hence the whole Train of Retaliations, restraints on Exportation, Prohibitions of Importation, alien duties, imposts—having thus rendered Communication among themselves almost impracticable, they were forced to look out for foreign settlements—hence Colonies, which might be worked like out farms for the Exclusive benefit of the metropolis, hence that wildest of wild Visions of Avarice and Ambition, the attempt to render the Ocean an Object of Property, a Claim of Possession in it, and Dominion over it. Thus Civilization was obstructed, improvement hindered, and the Light of Genius extinguished. Events may arise which may induce, Governors in Europe, to revise and reform, the hard Conditions of its Imprisonment, and give it Liberty.\nIn the new World, all the Inhabitants are free, and allow universal Naturalization to all that wish to be So, and a perfect Liberty of using any mode of Life they choose, or any Means of getting a Livelihood, that their Talents lead them to. Their Souls are their own: Their Reason is their own. They are their own masters: Their Labour is employed on their own Property, and what they produce is their own. Where every Man has the free, and full Exertion of his Powers, and may acquire any Share of Profit or Power, that his Spirit can work him up to; there an unabated Application, and a perpetual Struggle of Spirit sharpens the Wit, and trains the Mind. The Acquisition of Knowledge in Business, necessary to this Mode of Life, gives the Mind, a Turn of Investigation, which forms a Character peculiar to these People. This is called Inquisitiveness, which goes often to Ridicule, but is in Matters of Business and Commerce an usefull Talent. They are animated with the Spirit of the New Philosophy. Their Life is a Course of Experiments, and standing on as high ground of Improvement, as the most enlightened Parts of Europe have advanced, like Eaglets they commence the first Efforts of their Pinnions from a towering Advantage.\nIn Europe the poor Man’s Wisdom is despised. The poor MansWisdom, is not learning, but knowledge of his own picking up, from facts and nature, by simple Experience. In America, the Wisdom and not the Man is attended to: America is the Poor Mans Country. The Planters here reason not from what they hear but from what they see and feel. They follow what mode they like. They feel that they can venture to make Experiments, and the Advantages of their discoveries are their own. They therefore try, what the soil claims, what the Climate permits, and what both will produce to the greatest Advantage, in this way, they have brought into Cultivation, an Abundance, that no nation of the old World ever did, or could. They raise not only Plenty, and Luxury for their internal supply, but the Islands in the West Indies have been supplied from their Superabundance, and Europe, in many Articles has profited of it. It has had its fish from their seas: its wheat and flour from one part: its rice from another: its Tobacco and Indigo from another: its timber and naval stores from another: olives, oranges, Wines, are introducing by Experiments.\nThis spirit of Civilization, first attaches itself to Mother Earth, and the Inhabitants become Land workers. You see them labouring at the Plow, and the Spade, as if they had not an Idea, above the Earth; yet their Minds are all the while, enlarging all their powers, and their Spirit rises as their Improvements advance. Many a real philosopher, politician and Warrior, emerges out of this Wilderness, as the seed rises out of Ground.\nThey have also made many improvements in Handicrafts, Tools, and Machines. Want of Tools, and the Unfitness of such as they had, have put these Settlers to their shifts and these shifts are Experiments. Particular Uses calling for some Alteration have opened many a new Invention. More new Tools and Machines, and more new forms of old ones, have been issued in the new than were ever invented in the old in the same space of time.\nThe new World hath not turned its labour, into Arts and manufactures, because, their labour employed in its own natural Way can produce those things, which purchase Articles of Arts and manufactures, cheaper, than they could make them, but tho it dont manufacture for Sale, the settlers find Fragments of Time, which they cannot otherwise employ, in which they make most of the Articles of personal Ware and household Use, for home Consumption. When the Field shall be filled with Husbandmen, and the Classes of Handicrafts fully stocked, as there are no Laws which impose Conditions, on which a Man is to become intituled to exercise this or that trade, or by which he is excluded from exercising the one or the other, in this or thatplace: none that prescribe the manner in which, or the Prices at which he is to work, or that confine him even to the trade he was bred to: the moment that Civilization carried on in its natural Course is ripe for it: the Branch of Manufactures will take Root, and grow with an astonishing Rapidity.\nAltho, the Americans do not endeavour to force the Establishment of Manufactures; yet, following the natural progress of Improvement, they every Year produce a Surplus of Profit. With these surpluses and not with Manufactures they carry on their Commerce. Their fish, wheat, flour, rice, tobacco, indigo, live stock, barrel pork and beef (some of these being peculiar to the Country and staple Commodities) form their Exports. This has given them a direct Trade to Europe, and a circuitous Trade to Affrica and the West Indies.\nThe same Ingenuity in mechanicks, which accompanies their Agriculture, enters into their Commerce, and is exerted in Ship building: it is carried on, not only for their own freight, and that of the West Indies, but for sale, and supply a great part of the shipping of Britain; and if it continues to advance, will supply a great Part of the trade of Europe with ships, at cheaper Rates, then they can any where, or by any means, supply themselves. Thus their Commerce, altho under various Restrictions, while they were subordinate Provinces, by its advancing Progress in ship building, hath struck deep roots, and is now shot forth into an Active Trade, Amplitude of state and great Power.\nAn Objection. It will be said that the Ballance of Trade, has been at all times, against America, so as to draw all the Gold and silver from it, and for this Reason it cannot Advance in Commerce and oppulence. Answer. America, even while in depressed and restrained Provinces, has advanced its Cultivation to great oppulence, and constantly extending the Channells of its trade and increasing its shipping. Tis a fallacious Maxim to judge of the general Ballance of Profit in commerce by the Motions of one Article of Commerce, the prescious metals.\nThese metals, will always go to that Country, that pays the most for them. That Country, which on any sudden Emergency wants Money, and knows not how to circulate any other than silver and gold, must pay the most for them. The Influx of them therefore into a Country, instead of being a Consequence, of the ballance of trade being in its favor, or the Efflux being a Mark, of the Ballance being against it, may be proof of the contrary. The ballance of trade, reckoned by the import or Export of Gold and silver, may in manycases, be said to be against England, and in favour of those Countries to which its money goes. If this Import or Export was the Effect of a final settled account, instead of being, only the transfer of this Article to or from an Account currant, as it commonly is, yet it would not be a mark of the Ballance of Trade. England, from the nature of its Government and the Extent of its Commerce, has established a Credit, on which, on any Emergency, it can give Circulation to paper money, almost to any amount. If it could not, it must, at any rate, purchase gold and silver, and their would be a great Influx of the prescious metals. Will any one say, that this is a Symptom of the ballance of trade being in its favour? but on the contrary, having credit, from a progressive ballance of profit, it can, even in such an Emergency, spare its Gold and silver, and even make a Profit of it, as an Article of Commerce exported. Here We see, the ballance of profit creating a Credit, which circulates as money, even while its gold and silver are exported. If any Event like the late Recoinage of the Gold in England, which called in the old Coin at a better Price than that at which it was circulating abroad, should raise the Price of this Article in England, it will, for the same reason, as it went out, be again imported into England, not as a ballance of Accounts, but as an Article of trade, of which the best profit could at that moment be made. The fact was, that at that Period, quantities of English gold coin, to a great amount, were actually imported into England in bulk; and yet this was no mark of any sudden change of a ballance of trade in favour of that Country.\nThe ballance of trade, reckoned by this false rule, has been always said to be against N. America: but the fact is, that their Government profiting of a Credit arising from the progressive Improvements, and advancing Commerce of it <(which all the World sees as it is)>, hath by a refined policy, established a Circulation of Paper Money, to an Amount that is astonishing; that from the immense quantity it should depreciate, is nothing to this Argument; for it has had its Effect. The Americans therefore can spare their gold and silver, as well as England, and my Information says, there is now locked up in America more than three Millions, English Money, in gold and silver, which when their Paper is annihilated will come forth. The Efflux, therefore of gold and silver, is no proof of a ballance against them. On the contrary, being able to go on without gold and silver, but wanting other Articles, without which they could not proceed in their Improvements in Agriculture, Commerce, or War, the gold and silver is in part hoarded, and in part exported for these Articles. In fact, thisobjection, which is always given as an instance of Weakness in America, under which she must Sink, turns out, in the true state of it, an Instance of the most extensive Amplitude and Growth of state. It would be well for England, if while she tryumphs over this Mote in her Sisters Eye, would attend to the Beam in her own, and prepare for the Consequences of her own paper Money.\nFrom this Comparison of the Spirit of Civilization, applied to Agriculture, Mechanicks, and Commerce, extended through a large territory, having a free Communication, thro the whole, Governor Pownal asserts, that N. America has advanced, and is every day advancing, to a Growth of State, with a constant, and accellerating Motion of which there has never been any Example in Europe.\nHe proceeds to compare the two Countries, in the Progress of Population. In North America Children are a Blessing they are Riches and strength to the Parents. In Europe, Children are a Burden. The Causes of which have been with decided demonstration explained in the “Observations concerning the Increase of Mankind, the Peopling of Countries &c.” which he confirms by Examples of the actual increase,—The Mass. Bay, had of inhabitants in the year 1722, 94,000—in 1742, 164,000, in 1751—when there was a great depopulation both by War and the Small Pox 164,484—in 1761, 216,000—in 1765, 255,500—in 1771, 292,000, in 1773, 300,000.\nIn Connecticut, in 1756, 129,994—in 1774, 257,356. These numbers are not increased by strangers, but decreased by Wars and Emigrations to the Westward, and to other states. Yet they have nearly doubled in Eighteen Years.\nIn N. York in 1756, 96,776—in 1771, 168,007—in 1774, 182,251.\nIn Virginia in 1756, 173,316—in 1764, 200,000—in 1774, 300,000.\nIn S. Carolina 1750, 64,000—in 1770, 115,000. In R. Island, 1738, 15,000, in 1748, 28,439.\nAs there never was a Militia in Pensilvania, which authentic List of the Population, it has been variously estimated on Speculation. There was a continual Importation for many Years of irish and foreign Emigrants, yet many of these settled in other Provinces: but the progress of population, in the ordinary course, advanced in a ratio between that of Virginia, and that of Mass. Bay. The City of Philadelphia, advanced more rapidly. It had in 1749—2076 houses in 1753—2300 in 1760, 2969 in 1769, 4474, from 1749 to 1753 from 16, to 18,000 Inhabitants—from 1760 to 1769 from 31,318 to 35,000.\nThere were in 1754 various Calculations and Estimates made of the No. on the Continent. The sanguine, made the No. one million andan half. Those who admitted less speculation into the Calculation, but adhered closer to Facts and Lists as they were made out, Stated them at one million two hundred and fifty thousand. The Estimate said to be taken in Congress in 1774 makes them 3,026,678—but there must have been great Scope of Speculation in that Estimate. Another, after two or three Years of War, is 2,810,000. Govr. P. thinks that 2,141,307 would turn out nearest to the real amount in 1774. But what an amazing Progress, which in 18 years has added a million to a million two hundred and fifty thousand, altho a War was maintained in that Country for seven years of the term. In this view one sees a Community, unfolding itself, beyond any Example in Europe.\nBut the Model of these Communities, which has always taken place, from the Beginning, has enrolled every subject, as a soldier, and trained a greater Part, or 535,326 of these People to Arms, which Number the Community has, not seperate from the civil, and formed into a distinct body of regular Soldiers, but remaining united in the internal Power of the society, a national Piquet guard, always prepared for defence. This will be thought ridiculous by the regular Generals of Europe: but experience hath evinced, that for the very Reason that they are not a Seperate body, but members of the Community, they are a real and effectual national defence. He concludes with Lord Bacon, that the true Greatness of a State consisteth essentially in Population <and breed of Men>, and where there is Valour in individuals, and a military disposition in the frame of the Community: where all, and not particular conditions and degrees only, make profession of Arms, and bear them in their countrys defence.\nThis Country now is an Independant State, that hath taken its equal Station amidst the Nations of the Earth. It is an Empire, the Spirit of whose Government extends from theCenter to the extream Parts. Universal participation of Council, creates Reciprocation of universal Obedience. The Seat of Government will be well informed of the State and Condition of the remote and extream parts which by participation in the Legislature, will be informed and satisfied in the reasons and necessity of the measures of Government. These will consider themselves as acting in every grant that is made, and in every tax imposed. This Consideration will give Efficacy to Government, that Consensus Obedientium, on which the permanent Power of Empire is founded. This is the Spirit of the New Empire in America. It is liable to many Disorders, but young and Strong, like the Infant Hercules it will strangle these serpents, in the Cradle. Its Strengthwill grow with Years. It will establish its Constitution, and perfect Growth to Maturity. To this Greatness of Empire it will certainly arise. That it is removed 3000 miles from its Enemy: that it lies on another side of the Globe where it has no Enemy: that it is Earth born and like a Giant ready to run its Course, are not the only Grounds, on which a Speculatist may pronounce this.The fostering Care with which the Rival Powers of Europe will nurse it, ensures its Establishment, beyond all doubt or danger.\nWhen a State is founded on Such Amplitude of Territory: whose Intercourse is so easy: whose Civilization, is so advanced: where all is Enterprize and Experiment: where Agriculture has made so many discoveries, of new and peculiar Articles of Cultivation: where the ordinary Produce of bread Corn has been carried to a degree, that has made it a Staple Export, for the supply of the old World: whose Fisheries are mines producing more Solid Riches than all the silver of Potosi: Where Experiment hath invented So many new and ingenious Improvements, in Mechanicks: where the Arts, Sciences, Legislation and Politicks, are Soaring with a Strong and extended Pinion: where Population has multiplied like the Seeds of the Harvest: Where the Power of these Numbers, taking a military Form, shall lift up itself as a young Lion; where Trade of extensive orbit, circulating in its own shipping, has wrought up these Efforts of the Community to an active Commerce: where all these Powers have united and taken the form of Empire: I may suppose I cannot err, or give offence to the greatest Power in Europe, when Upon a Comparison of the state of Mankind, and of the Powers of Europe, with that of America I venture to suggest to their Contemplation, that America is growing too large for any Government in Europe to manage as subordinate. That the Government, of North America, is too firmly fixed in the Hands of its own Community, to be either directed by other Hands, or taken out of those in which it is: and that the Power in Men and Arms, is too much to be forced, at the distance of 3000 Miles. Were I to ask an Astronomer, whether, if a satellite should grow, untill it could ballance with its Planet, whether that globe so increased, could be held any longer by any of the Powers of Nature, in the orbit of a satellite, and whether any external Force could hold it there, he will answer me, directly, No. If I ask a father, whether, after his son is grown up, to full strength of Body Mind and Reason, he can be held in Pupillage, and will suffer himself to be treated and corrected as a Child, he must answer No. Yet if I ask, an European Politician, who learns by Hearsay, and thinks by Habit, whether N. America willremain dependent he answers, Yes. He will have a thousand reasons, why it must be so, altho fact rises in his face to the very contrary. Politicians, instead of being employed to find out reasons to explain facts, are often employed with a multitude about them, to invent and make facts, according to predetermined Reasonings. Truth, however, will prevail. This is not said to prove, but to explain the Fact, so that the Consequences may be seen. The present Combination of Events whether attended to or not, whether wrought by Wisdom into the system of Europe or not, will force its way there, by the Vigour of natural Causes. Europe, in the Course of its Commerce, and even in the internal order and Oeconomy of its Communities, will be affected by it. The Statesman cannot prevent its Existence, nor resist its Operation. He may embroil his own Affairs; but it will become his best Wisdom, and his Duty to his Sovereign and the People, that his measures coincide and cooperate with it.\nThe first of the Consequences is, the Effect, which this Empire, become a great naval power, will have on the Commerce, and by Changes in that, on the political system of the old World.\nWhoever understands the Hanseatic League, and its progress, by possessing the commanding Articles of the Commerce of the World; the command of the great Rivers; its being the Carrier of Europe: in consequent active naval Power, that could attract, resist, and even command the landed powers; that it was made up of Seperate and unconnected Towns, included within the dominions, of other States; that they had no natural Communication, and only an artificial Union: whoever considers not only the commercial but naval and political Power, which this League established throughout Europe; will see, on how much more solid a Basis, the Power of North America, stands: how much faster it must grow, and to what an Ascendancy, of Interest, carrying on the greatest part of the Commerce, and commanding the greatest Part of the Shipping of the World, this great commercial and naval Power, must Soon arrive. If the League, without the natural Foundation of a political Body, in Land, could grow by Commerce and navigation to such Power: if, of Parts seperated by Nature, and only joined by Art and Force, could become a great political Body, acting externally with an Interest and Power, that took a lead, and even an Ascendancy in Wars and Treaties? What must N. America, removed at the distance of half the Globe, from all the obstructions of rival powers, founded in a landed Dominion, peculiarly adapted for Communication of Commerce, and Union of Power, rise to in its Progress? As the Hanseatick League,grew to Power, Denmark, Sweeden, Poland, and France, Sought its Alliance (under the common Veil of Pride) by offers of becoming its Protectors. England also, growing fast into a commercial Power, had commercial Arrangements by Treaty with it. Just So now, will the Sovereigns of Europe, just so have, the Bourbon Compact, the greatest Power in Europe, courted the Friendship of America. Standing on Such a Basis, and growing Up, under Such Auspices, one may pronounce of America, as was said of Rome—Civitas, incredibile est memoratu, a deptà Libertate quantum brevi creverit. I mark what may be, by what has been.\nIn the Course of this American War, all the Powers of Europe, at least the maritime powers, will one after another, as some of the first leading Powers have already done, apply to the States of America, for a share in their trade, and for a Settlement of the Terms on which they may carry it, on with them. America, will then become the arbitress of the commercial (and perhaps as the seven United Belgic Provinces were in the Year 1647) the mediatrix of peace, and of the political business of the World.\nIf N: America follows the Principles on which Nature has established her; and if the European Alliances which she has already made do not involve her in, and Seduce her to, a Series of Conduct destructive of that System, which those Principles lead to; She must observe, that as Nature hath seperated her from Europe, and hath established her alone on a great Continent, far removed from the old World, and all its embroiled Interests and wrangling Politicks, without an Enemy or a Rival or the Entanglement of Alliances. 1. That it is, contrary to her Interest and the nature of her Existence, that she should have any Connections of Politicks with Europe, other than merely commercial; and even on that ground, to observe inviolably the Caution of not being involved, in Either the quarrells, or the Wars of the Europeans. 2. That the real State of America is, that of being the common Source of supply to Europe in general; and that her true Interest is therefore that of being a free Port to all Europe at large; and that all Europe at large should be the common Market for American Exports. The true Interest, therefore of America, is, not to form any partial connections, with any Part to the Exclusion of the rest. If England had attended to her true Interest, as connected with that of America, she would have known, that it is the Commerce, and not the Conquest of America, by which she could be benefited; and if she would even yet, with temper listen to her true Interest, she would still find, that that Commerce would, in a great measurecontinue with the Same benefit, were the two Countries as independent of each other as France and Spain, because in many Articles, neither of them can go to a better Market. This is meant, as under their present Habits and Customs of Life. Alienation may change all this.\nThe first great leading Principle will be, that N. America will become a free Port to all the nations of the World, indiscriminately; and will expect, insist on, and, demand, in fair Reciprocity, a free market in all those nations with whom she trades. This will, if she forgets not, nor forsakes her real nature, be the Basis, of all her commercial Treaties. If she adheres to this Principle, she must be, in the course of time, the chief Carrier of the Commerce of the whole World: because, unless the several powers of Europe, become to each other, likewise, free Ports and free marketts, America alone will come to and act there, with an ascendant Interest that must command every Advantage to be derived from them.\nThe Commerce of N. America, being no longer the Property of one Country only: her Articles of supply will come freely, and be found now in all the markets of Europe: not only moderated by, but moderating the Prices of the like Articles of Europe. The Furs and Peltry, will meet those of the north East part of Europe; and neither the one nor the other can any longer be estimated by the Advantages to be taken of an exclusive Vent. Advantages of this Kind, on Iron, and naval Stores, have frequently been aimed at by Sweeden: and the monopoly in them was more than once used as an Instrument of Hostility against England, which occasioned the bounties on these Articles, the Growth of America, which gave rise to the Export of them from America: when they come freely to the European marketts, cooperating with the Effect which those of Russia have, will break that monopoly, for Russia, by the Conquest of Livonia, and the Advancement of her Civilization, has become a source of supply, in these Articles, to a great Extent. All Europe by the Intervention of this American Commerce, will find the good Effects of a fair Competition, both in Abundance of Supply, and in moderation of Price. Even England who hath lost the monopoly, will be no great loser on this score: she will find this natural Competition as advantageous to her, as the monopoly, which, in bounties, and other costs of protection she paid so dear for. Ship building and navigation, haveing made such progress in America, that they are able to build and navigate cheaper than any country in Europe, even than Holland with all her Aeconomy. There will arise a Competition in this branch of com­merce. In this branch the dutch will find a powerful Rivalry, from that maritime people the Americans. They will also find, in the Marketts of Europe, a Competition in the branch of the Fisheries. The Rice and Corn, which the Americans have been able to export, to an Amount that Supplied, in the European market, the defect arising from England’s withholding her Exports, will keep down depressed the Agriculture of Portugal and Spain, and in some measure of France, if the policy of those Countries does not change the Regulations, and order of their internal Oeconomy. The peculiar Articles, to be had as yet from America only, which Europe so much seeks after, will give the Americans the command of the market in those Articles, and enable them, by annexing assortments of other Articles, to produce these also, with Advantage in these marketts. The refuse fish, flour, Maize, meat, live stock, lumber &c., all carried in American shipping to the W. India Islands: the African slaves, carried by a circuitous trade, in American Shipping also to the W. India marketts: taking from thence the molasses: aiding those Islands with American shipping, in the Carriage of their produce, must ever command and have the Ascendency in the Commerce of that Part of the World, if this Ascendency even Stops here. The cheap manner, in which the Americans produce their Articles of Supply: the low rates at which they carry them to Europe, Selling also their shipping there: the small Profits at which their merchants are content to trade, must lower the price of the like Articles in Europe: oblige the European merchants to be content with less profit: occasion some Reform in the Oeconomy of Europe in raising and police in bringing to market, the native Articles of supply. But further the Americans, by their Principle of being a free port in America, and having a free market in Europe; by their Policy of holding themselves, as they are remote from all the wrangling Politicks, So neutral in all the Wars of Europe: by their Spirit of Enterprise in all the quarters of the globe, will oblige the Nations of Europe to call forth within themselves such a Spirit, as must entirely change its commercial system also.\nBut will a people whose Empire Stands Singly predominant on a great Continent, who before they lived under their own Government, had pushed their Spirit of Adventure in Search of a N. West Passage to Asia, which as their own discovery, they meant to have claimed as their own peculiar Right, Suffer in their borders the Establishment of such a monopoly as the European Hudsons Bay Company? Will that Spirit which has forced an extensive commerce in the two bays of Honduras and Compeachy, and on the Spanish main, and whohave gone to Falklands Islands in search only of Whales, be stopped at Cape Horn, or not pass the Cape of good Hope? It will not be long after their Establishment as an Empire, before they will be found trading in the south Sea and in China. The Dutch will hear of them in Spice Islands, to which the Dutch can have no Claim; and which those Enterprising People will contest, on the very ground, and by the very Arguments, which the Dutch used to contest the Same Liberty against Portugal. By the Intercourse and Correspondence which there will be between Europe and America, it will be as well known, as Europe: by attention to the Winds, Currents, the Gulph Stream and its Lee Currents, the Passage will be better understood and become shorter: America will seem every day to approach nearer and nearer to Europe. When the Alarm which the Idea of going to a Strange and distant Country gives to a Manufacturer or Peasant, or even a Country Gentleman, shall be thus worn out; a thousand attractive motives respecting a settlement in America, will raise a Spirit of Adventure, and become the irresistable Cause of a general Emigration to that World. Nothing but Some, future, wise and benevolent <Spirit of> Policy in Europe, or Some Spirit of the Evil one, which may mix itself in the Policy of America can prevent it. Many of the most usefull enterprising Spirits, and much of the active property will go there. Exchange hath taught the statesmen of the World long ago, that they cannot confine money, and the Governments of Europe, must fall back to the feudal Tyranny, in which its own people are locked up, and from which all others are excluded, or Commerce will open a Door to Emigration.\nThese Relations of Things—these Legesque et foedera rerum, are forming what Governor Pownal concieves to be the new System. The sublime Politician, who ranges in Regions of predetermined systems—the man of the World, narrowed by a selfish Experience, worse than Ignorance will not believe him: and it is but slowly, that Nations relinquish any System, which hath derived Authority from time and habit. Those Sovereigns of Europe, who have despised the Awkward Youth of America, and neglected to form Connections, and interweave their interests with those of these rising states, shall find the system of this new Empire, obstructing and superseding the old system of Europe, and crossing all their Maxims and measures, they will call upon their Ministers Come Curse me this people, for they are too mighty for me. The Spirit of Truth will answer, How shall I curse whom God hath not cursed? How shall I defy whom the Lord hath not defied? From the Top of the Rock I see them, from the HillsI behold them. Lo! the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations. On the Contrary, those Sovereigns, who shall see things as they are, and form, if not the earliest, yet the most sure and natural Connection with America, as an Independant State, the Markett of, and a free Port to Europe: as that Being which must have a free markett in Europe, will become the principal leading Power in Europe, in regulating the Courses of the rest, and in settling the common Center of all.\nEngland is the state that is in those Circumstances and in that situation. Similar Modes of living and thinking, manners and fashions, Language and Habits, all conspire naturally to a rejuncture by Alliance. If England, would treat America as what she is, she might still have the Ascendancy in trade and navigation: might still have a more solid and less invidious power than that magni nominis Umbra, with which she braves the whole World. She might yet have an active leading Interest among the powers of Europe. But she will not. As though the Hand of Judgment was upon her, England will not see the things which make for her peace. France, and other States will follow the Example, acknowledging these states to be what they are, has formed Alliances with them on terms of perfect Equality and Reciprocity. And behold the Ascendant, to which she directly arose, from that politick Humiliation. There never was a wiser or firmer Step taken by any established power, than that which the new states in America took, for their first footing in this Alliance: there never was more Address, Art, or Policy shown by any State, than France has given Proof of in the Same; when both agreed and became allied on terms, which exclude no other Power, from enjoying the Same Benefits, by a like Treaty. Can it be supposed that other States, conceiving that the exclusive trade of England, to America, is laid open, will not desire, and have their share? They certainly will. Here then are the Beginnings of changes in the European System.\nThere are two Courses in which, this general Intercourse of Commerce, between Europe and N. America, may come into operation: one, by particular Treaties of commerce: the other by all the maritime States of Europe, previous to their engaging in a War, or upon the general Settlement of a Peace, meeting in Some Congress to regulate among themselves, as well as with north America, the Free Port on one Hand, and the free Markett on the other; as also general Regulations of Commerce and navigation, Such as must Suit this free trader, now common to them all, indifferently, and without preference. Such Regulations, must exclude all Monopoly of this Sourceof Supply and Course of Trade; and So far make an essential Change in the commercial System: such Regulations, not having Reference only to America, but reciprocal References between all the contracting Parties, trading now under different Circumstances, and Standing towards each other in different Predicaments, must necessarily change the whole of that System in Europe.\nThe American will come to market in his own ship, and will claim the Ocean as Common; will claim a navigation restrained by no Laws, but the Law of Nations, reformed as the rising Crisis requires: will claim a free Market, not only for his Goods but his ship, which will make a Part of his Commerce. America being a free Port to all Europe, the American will bring to Europe not only his own peculiar Staple produce, but every Species of his produce, which the market of Europe can take off: he will expect to be free to offer to Sale in the European markett, every Species of wrought materials, which he can make to answer in that markett: and further as his commerce subsists by a circuitous Interchange with other Countries and Regions, whence he brings Articles, not Singly for his own consumption, but as exchangeable Articles, with which to trade in foreign marketts; he will claim as one of the conditions of the free markett, that these foreign Articles, as well as his own produce shall be considered as free for him to import in his own shipping: to such markett. Those states who refuse this at first, Seeing others acquiesce in it, and Seeing also how they profit by having Articles of supply and Trade brought So much cheaper to them, will be obliged, in their own defence, and to maintain their ballance in the commercial World, to acceed to the Same Liberty. Hence again, even if the American should not, by these means, become the ascendant Interest in the Carrying Trade, and in shipping and Seamen, a most essential change must arise in the European System.\nThe American, raises his produce, and navigates cheaper than any other can: his Staples, are Articles which he alone can Supply: these will come to market assorted with others, which he thus can most conveniently supply; and unless the same freedom of trade which he enjoys, be reciprocally given and taken by the European powers, among each other, he will come to the European market on terms, which no other can, but Europe will be affected, benefited and improved by his manner of trading. The peculiar Activity of the American, will raise a Spirit and activity among those who come to the same market. That peculiar turn of Character, that Inquisitiveness, which in business animates a Spirit of investigation to everyextent, and the minutest detail, enables them to conduct their dealings, in a manner more advantageous, than is usually practiced by the European merchant. They acquire a Knowledge not only of the marketts of Europe, i.e. of the Wants and supplies, how they correspond, and of their relative values; but they never rest, till they are possessed of a knowledge of every Article of produce and manufacture, which comes to those marketts; untill they know the establishments, the operations and the prices of labour, and the profits made on each, as well, or even better, than merchants of the Country themselves. A little before the War, several of the American Merchants, especially those of Pensilvania, sending some of their own house to England, became their own factors, went immediately to the Manufacturers in Birmingham, Wolverhampton, and Sheffield; to the woolen manufacturers in Yorkshire and Lancashire: to those of Liverpool: and those in the west: and opened an immediate traffic with them at the first hand. This same Spirit of Investigation and Activity, will actuate their dealings in every other country of Europe. The Effect of this, instead of being disadvantageous, to those countries, will become a general blessing, by raising a more general competition, and diffusing a more proportional share of profit, between all ranks of the industrious. While trade is solely in the hands of the merchant, he bears hard on the purchaser, by his high profit, and oppresses the manufacturer, by the little share, he allows him. The merchant grows rich and magnificent, makes a great Bustle and figure. It can never be well, where Merchants are Princes. The more the merchant can make by high profit, the less quantity will he carry to market. Whereas, when Commerce shall be free, and by the mixture of this american Spirit, trade runs, with fair competition in a broad channell the merchant must make his Way by being content with small profit, and by doing a deal of business on those small profits. The consumer and manufacturer will come nearer together. The one will save an unreasonable Advance and the other obtain a more equal share of profit. More work will be done: the profits of Industry more equally distributed, the circulation will spread thro the lesser vessels, and Life Health and Growth promoted.\nIf these operations take this Course, it will be needless to point out to the shrewd Speculations of the Merchants what their conduct must necessarily be: but it will behove Statesmen, to be aware, that they do not Suffer the merchant to persuade them, that the Commerce is languishing, merely because there is not the same parade of Wealth, in such dazzling Instances. Let them look to the markettsof supply, and see if there is not plenty. Next to the rude produce which is the Basis of manufactures, and enquire, whether, while more and more Industry is daily called forth, it is not employed and more adequately paid by a free and extended Vent? While the No. and ingenuity of manufacturers increases, they do not all live more comfortably, so as to have and maintain increasing families? Whether population does not increase. Let them, in future guard against the exclusive temper of Trade. The political founders of the old System, were totally ignorant of this principle of commerce. It was Wisdom with them to render their neighbours and customers poor. By a wretched System of taxation they effectually prevented the Stock of labour and profit from accumulating. But if the Statesmen of the present enlightened Age, will follow, where Experience, leads to truth and right, they will throw the Activity of Mankind into its proper course of productive labour. When man has the liberty of exerting his Industry and Ingenuity, as he can make them the most productive, finds a free Market, and his Share of profit, then is the ground duly prepared for Population, opulence, and Strength. Then will the Sovereigns of Europe find their Interest, and their Power in their Peoples Happiness.\nIf the Sovereigns of Europe, should find in the Example of England, that the System of Colonies in distant regions for the Purpose of Monopolies, is at an end, and turn their Attention, to give Exertion to their own internal powers like the police of China, cultivate their waste lands, improve Agriculture, encourage manufactures, abolish Corporations: as all the remnants of Barbarism, shall be removed, the powers of the Community will create those surpluses which will become the Source, and open the channells of commerce. If they should see in the Examples of Spain and England, the Disappointments of attempts to establish a Monopoly of navigation, by the force of laws, instead of creating or maintaining it, by the Spirit of an active commerce: that all the Prohibitions by which they labour to oppress their neighbours do but depress themselves, they may come to think, that giving Freedom and Activity to commerce, is the true System of every commercial Country. Suppose them, checked in their Career of War, hesitating on the Maxims of their old system: perceiving that the Oeconomical Activity in Europe, is on the Turn to take a new Course: feeling the force of an active commerce; finding themselves under the necessity of making Some reform, should begin to Speculate, how, amidst a Number of Powers of Trade, Shifting their Scale, an even ballance may be formed, and Secured. How amidst a numberof Interests, floating on the Turn of this great Tide in the Affairs of Men, an equal level may be obtained. If on a review of their old System, they should perceive how it is prepared for change—they may find that Commerce, which might have risen by Competition, Industry, Frugality and ingenuity, hath long been an exclusive, Scrambling rivalship. Instead of being an equal, Communication concentring the Enjoyments of all regions and climates, and a Consociation of all nations in one Communion of the blessings of Providence: when actuated as it has been by a selfish Principle, it hath been to the Nations an occasion of Jealousies; alternate depressions of each others Interests, and a never ceasing Source of Wars, perhaps they may also see that treaties, of Peace have been but truces, and guarrantees so many entangling preparations for future Wars. On the other hand, they should see with pleasure, that the manners of mankind, softening by degrees have become more humanized; their Police more civilized: and altho many of the old oppressive Institutions of Government, as they respect Husbandmen, Manufacturers, Merchants, Marketts and Commerce, have not yet been formally abolished; yet that Practice, by various Accommodations, have abrogated their most mischeivious operations. That the Activity of Man finds every day, a freer Course: that there are a thousand Ways, which altho pride will not open, prudence will connive at, through which the intercourse of Marketts finds every year, a freer vent: and that the active Spirit of commerce is like the Spirit of Life, diffusing itself through the whole Mass of Europe. They will find there is an End of all their monopolizing Systems. They will see that any one of the powers of Europe, who would aim to deal with the rest of Mankind with an unequal ballance; will only find, that they have raised among their neighbours, a Jealousy that shall conspire to wrest that false ballance out of their hands, and to depress them down again, to a level with the rest of the World. The Cities of Italy, the Low Countries, Portugal, Holland, England, have all, for their period, as commercial powers, arisen above the common Level, but pressing with a Weight which was felt as unequal by those below them; they have each in its turn found, even in the moment of their highest Elevation a general rising all around them, and themselves sinking to the common level. Statesmen must see, how much it is the interest of all, to liberate each other, from the Restraints, Prohibitions and Exclusions, by which they have aimed to depress each other. They will see, that the most advantageous Way, which a landed nation can take, to encourage and multiply Artificers, Manufacturers andMerchants of their own, is to grant the most perfect freedom, to the Artificers Manufacturers and merchants of every other nation. That a contrary Practice, lowers the value of their own internal Productions, by raising the prices of all things which must be bought with them: and gives to the Artificers, Manufacturers and merchants a monopoly against their own farmers. Seeing this they will encourage Population, and an universal naturalization and liberty of Conscience. If nature has so formed man, and Policy, Society, that each labouring in his line, produces a surplus of Supply, it is both perfect Justice and Policy, that men and nations should be free, reciprocally to interchange it. This communion of nations, is a right which may be enjoyed, in its genuine spirit and utmost extent, except in time of War, and even then to a great degree, without interfering in the political and civil power of the World. The Spirit of those exclusive Laws of navigation will appear as the Spirit of piracy. The common ocean, incapable of being defined, or of a Special occupancy, or of recieving exclusively the labour of any Individual, Person or state, is incapable of becoming an Object of Property—never an object of Dominion: and that, therefore, the ocean, should in policy, as it is in fact, remain common and free. Pervium cunctis Iter. If it should be seen that the commercial system of Europe is changing, and in Wisdom and policy ought to be changed: that the great Commerce of North America emancipated from its provincial state, not only coincides with, but is a concurring cause of this change; that the present Combination of Events form a Crisis, which Providence with a more than ordinary Interposition hath prepared: and that Heaven itself Seems to call upon sovereigns to cooperate with its gracious Providence, if they should be convinced that there is nothing so absurd as Warring against each other about an object, which as it is Seperated from Europe, will have nothing to do with its Broils, and will not belong exclusively to any of them. If listening to this Voice, which as that of an Angel, announcing Peace and good Will to mankind, summons them to leave off the endless useless operations of War: to consider the present Crisis as an object of Council and not of War and therefore to meet in Communications and Intercourse of their reasoning Powers.\nThe Maritime Powers, must, before Peace respecting America, and the mixed Interests of Europe and America, can be even treated of, convene by their Consuls, Commissioners or other Ministers, in order to consider the Several points on which the War broke out—the points in Claim, and in contest, the points on which they maysafely suspend Hostilities, and those which must form the Basis of Treaty, and which will enter into the future System, and on which Peace may not only made, but established among the nations of the Atlantic ocean.\nWill not, Reason and Benevolence, then, in which true Policy and their right and best Interest is included, Suggest to their Hearts; and actuate their Councils to convene a Congress before they are engaged in further Hostilities before the devastation of War extends Ruin and misery yet farther. Some such measure, as led the great trading Bodies of Europe to convene in a Congress, which gave rise to the Hanseatic League, is not out of the Course of public business but is, what the Nature of the present crisis, in a more than ordinary necessity, requires. Whether Some general council, on the model of that concerted between the great Henry of France and Elizabeth of England, two as noble Spirits and as wise Politicians as the World hath Since Seen, should not now be proposed, not indeed a Council of Administration, for regulating and conducting a general political system of all Europe, but a Council of Commerce, for Europe and N. America exclusive of every point of Politicks. As such it should remain, a standing perpetual Council of deliberation and Advice, and a seat of Judicial Administration common to all. Also a Great and General Court of Admiralty, to take Cognizance of Disputes, and offences, which shall be committed against the general laws of trade.\nSuch a Council might not only prevent, a most dreadful general War, which Seems to be coming on in Europe (by the Way a very great mistake) but might be forever a means of preventing, future occasions of War, from commercial quarulls, the present vague State of the marine Law of nations, seems to be such, as creates a necessity of such a measure. At present all Principle, Rule and Law, seems to be as much lost, as if the nations were fallen back to the old State of Piracy, under their old Barbarism. Europe cannot, even in War, go on under the present Abrogation of all treaties, and all the Laws of nations.\nThe Cardinal Points which will come under deliberation will be 1. how far in Right and Policy, it may be best for all to establish, the Mare liberum: and how far each Nation (providing for the property and Dominion, which they hold in Bays and Harbours,) may acceed to this Establishment, as a law of nations. 2. how far the universal Jus navigandi may be established 3. This will lead to deliberation on the Libertas universalis Commerciorum Free Ports and Free Marketts. Next Port Duties and Toll Marketts. It will be best bydegrees to abolish all Port duties, and raise their revenues by Exise, Tailles, &c. and other internal Sources of finance, immediately laid on the Consumer. This measure would make that Country which adopted it a free port a circumstance very desirable to every well Wisher to his Country. They will deliberate first, on the Nature and Extent of the conditional grants of Priviledges of Trade, which,Under the Air of Protection, they shall offer to America: Under this Idea, they must settle with her, and amongst each other quite new Arrangements of Tarifs, &c.\nVoila tout ce qu’on peut raisonablement, exiger. Il n’est au pouvoir, de l’humanité, que de preparer, et agir. Le Succes est l’ouvrage d’un main plus puissante. Sulli. Liv. 30.\nIn a former Letter I have given Congress, some Observations on a Letter of Mr. H. This contains an Account of the substance of a Volume of Governor Pownall, which as the Book is not my own I cannot send to Congress as I wish to do. Both have Relation to the Object of my Mission. These two Gentlemen have both declared themselves, in Parliament for pacific measures, but from some sentiments in these Writings, it is not very likely they will succeed. Both seem to be wholly uninformed of the State of Europe. Both seem to suppose that the Powers of Europe, the maritime Powers will go to War, with the English against us and our Allies. Congress were fully informed last August that there was no danger of this. The late Declaration of the Ottoman Port, of the Empress of Russia, and the measures taking by the other maritime Powers demonstrate that the Information Congress then received was right, and the Imaginations of these Writers of general Wars are groundless. There may be indeed some danger, that the Pride and Obstinacy of the English, may involve every maritime Power, in a War as well as a league against them.\nI have the Honour to be, with entire Respect and Attachment, sir your most obedient and humble servant.\nJohn Adams"

I Should recommend to you Books of Morals, as the most constant Companions, of your Hours of Relaxation, through the whole Course of your Life. There is in Barbeyrac’s Writings, an History of the Rise and Progress of the science of Morality which I would have you read with Care, early in Life. It is printed with his Puffendorf I think in English.\nThe Writings of Clark, Cudworth, Hutchinson, Butler, Woolaston, and many Sermons, upon Morals subjects will be worth your Attention, as well as Cicero Seneca &c.\nI cannot enlarge, because the Post is on the Point of departing.\nYour affectionate Father\nJohn Adams"

    "content": "Boston, 4th October 1768.\nDear Sir,\nI was absent upon one of our circuits when Mr. Byles arrived. Since my return I have received from him your obliging letter of 31st July. I never dared to think what the resentment of the nation would be upon Hallowell’s arrival. It is not strange that measures should be immediately taken to reduce the colonies to their former state of government and order, but that the national funds should be effected by it is to me a little mysterious and surprizing. Principles of government absurd enough, spread thro’ all the colonies; but I cannot think that in any colony, people of any consideration have ever been so mad as to think of a revolt. Many of the common people have been in a frenzy, and talk’d of dying in defence of their liberties, and have spoke and printed what is highly criminal, and too many of rank above the vulgar, and somein public postshave countenanced and encouraged them untill they increased so much in their numbers and in their opinion of their importance as to submit to government no further than they thought proper. The legislative powers have been influenced by them, and the executive powers intirely lost their force. There has been continual danger of mobs and insurrections, but they would have spent all their force within ourselves, the officers of the Crown and some of the few friends who dared to stand by them possibly might have been knock’d in the head, and some such fatal event would probably have brought the people to their senses. For four or five weeks past the distemper has been growing, and I confess I have not been without some apprehensions for myself, but my friends have had more for me, and I have hadrepeated and frequent notices from them from different quarters,one of the last I will inclose to you. In this state of things there was no security but quitting my posts, which nothing but the last extremity would justify. As chief justice for two years after our first disorders I kept the grand juries tollerably well to their duty. The last spring there had been several riots, and a most infamous libel had been published in one of the papers, which I enlarged upon, and the grand jury had determined to make presentments, but the attorney-general not attending them the first day, Otis and his creatures who were alarmed and frightned exerted themselves the next day and prevailed upon so many of the jury to change their voices, that there was not a sufficient number left to find a bill. They have been ever since more enraged against me than ever. At the desire of the governor I committed to writing the charge while it lay in my memory, and as I have no further use for it I will inclose it as it may give you some idea of our judicatories.\nWhilst we were in this state, news came of two regiments being ordered from Halifax, and soon after two more from Ireland. The minds of people were more and more agitated, broad hints were given that the troops should never land, a barrel of tar was placed upon the beacon, in the night to be fired to bring in the country when the troops appeared, and all the authority of the government was not strong enough to remove it. The town of Boston met and passed a number of weak but very criminal votes; and as the governor declined calling an assembly they sent circular letters to all the towns and districts to send a person each that there might be a general consultation at so extraordinary a crisis. They met and spent a week, made themselves ridiculous, and then dissolv’d themselves, after a message or two to the governor which he refused to receive; a petition to the King which I dare saytheir agentswill never be allow’d to present, and a result which they have published ill-natured and impotent.\nIn this confusion the troops from Halifax arrived. I never was much afraid of the people’s taking arms, but I was apprehensiveof violence from the mob, it being their last chance before the troops could land. As the prospect of revenge became more certain their courage abated in proportion. Two regiments are landed, but a new grievance is now rais’d. The troops are by act of parliament to be quartered no where else but in the barracks until they are full. There are barracks enough at the castle to hold both regiments. It is therefore against the act to bring any of them into town. This was started by the council in their answer to the governor, which to make themselves popular, they in an unprecedented way published and have alarmed all the province; for although none but the most contracted minds could put such a construction upon the act, yet after this declaration of the council nine tenths of the people suppose it just. I wish the act had been better express’d, but it is absurd to suppose the parliament intended to take from the King the direction of his forces by confining them to a place where any of the colonies might think fit to build barracks. It is besides ungrateful, for it is known to many that this provision was brought into the bill after it had been framed without it, from meer favor to the colonies. I hear the commander in chief has provided barracks or quarters, but a doubt still remains with some of the council, whether they are to furnish the articles required, unless the men are in the province barracks, and they are to determine upon it to day.\nThe government has been so long in the hands of the populace that it must come out of them by degrees, at least it will be a work of time to bring the people back to just notions of the nature of government.\nMr. Pepperrell a young gentleman of good character, and grandson and principal heir to the late Sir William Pepperrell being bound to London, I shall deliver this letter to him, as it will be too bulky for postage, and desire him to wait upon you with it. I am with very great esteem, Sir, your most humble and most obedient servant,\nTho. Hutchinson."

    "content": "Helvoetsluys October 31. 1795.\nMy Dear Sir\nI have been detained about ten days in this place, waiting for a wind, and am very like to be detained as many more; the westerlywinds prevailing in the channel at this Season of the year almost without intermission.\nSince my arrival here I have received your favour of August 25. transmitted to me by my Brother, who remains at the Hague, with the care of our affairs during my absence.— Independent of the pleasure which a letter from you must always afford me, I cannot express the happiness it gives me, to have the repeated testimonials of your approbation, and the assurance that my performance of my duties here has been acceptable. For the force of expressions, used especially in your last Letter I endeavour to make the allowance which I feel to be necessary. As evidence of your kindness and indulgence it is gratifying in the highest degree\nBut if the opinions which you mention as being entertained of my correspondence, have not received a very high colouring from parental affection, they are such as would give me still more anxiety than delight. Undeserved estimation is still more dangerous than flattery and may be much more pernicious because itmustbe the result of error: A baseless reputation is one of the things on earth that I should most fervently deprecate, and I hope you will not think it ridiculous, if I assure you, that to find myself so much over-rated, by judgment so respectable would be to me a subject of serious alarm. For yourapprobation, for that of the Executive Ministers with whom my correspondence is maintained, I can never cease to be solicitous, but I am equally desirous, that not only the expression of their opinions, but even the opinions themselves, may be confined to simple approbation; that the former may not extend toapplause, nor the latter toadmiration.\nThese observations, with which my mind has long laboured, but which I have not hitherto ventured to communicate even in the confidence of filial affection and gratitude, may perhaps be rendered more excusable at the present moment, when the orders in consequence of which I am now at this place have been most recently received. Although the business upon which I am now employed is doubtless, the simple execution of orders, in which there will be little or no discretion admissible, and although the circumstances of local proximity and convenience for expedition, afforded the preponderant inducements for commanding my services on this occasion, yet it naturally presents itself to my mind, as an indication not barely of a continued but even of an increased confidence; I will add, of a confidence more incommensurate with my talents ormerits, than was my original appointment to this Country. Under these circumstances, I think it becomes less improper to suggest my apprehensions to you, and to guard myself against the dangers, which may derive not only to myself but to my Country from a possible opinion, too favourable to me.\nThe service indeed upon which I am now ordered has nothing to please in prospect. To deal with a British Minister; to deal with him after Mr:Jay, and with the furious persecution that this Gentleman has suffered for this very transaction, fresh before my eyes, and yet rumbling in my ears, has nothing attractive to ambition, or flattering to hope. On one side the perspective is illiberal and captious negotiation, and probable failure, or such a success as will be not much better; on the other is virulent reproach and abuse to extend as usual, to my nearest friends, and lavished more on them than on me. That both these things will be combined for my endurance in the course of the business is highly probable. One or the other of them is inevitable; for the existence of the first in its utmost extent, will be the only possible protection against the certainty of the second.\nThese anticipations do not however in themselves form my principal concern. I know that success is seldom at human disposal, and that censure if unmerited is an evil, not intolerable. It is not therefore theresponsibilityof this agency that I dread, but it isthe magnitude of the trust, and my own incompetency; the first being only my personal concern; but the last involving the most important interests, and the welfare of my Country\nIt is possible that the result of my present mission may ascertain the termination of my residence in Europe, independent of any act of my own will: or perhaps it will serve to give a direction to it. Your recommendation to me to return to America, at the close of a three years absence, unless removed to a different scene, and raised to an higher trust, will have as all advice from you will always have great weight in my mind. But I must assure you in the most unequivocal manner, that I have not the shadow of a wish for a more elevated rank than that in which I am now placed, and that, of the only two American Missions in Europe, where the higher character is employed, I consider the English as an object of aversion and the French of indifference.\nAs there is no present prospect of vacancy in either of those places, it will be unnecessary for me to give you the numerous reasons upon which my sentiments concerning them are formed. Adislike both of the Government and National character, perhaps amounting even to a prejudice, is the principal ground of the first, and the unsettled revolutionary State of the Country, is at least a counterbalance to any predilection I might otherwise entertain in favour of the other.\nBesides these considerations, if I had not collected a sufficient portion of the “Stoic Spirit,” to dull the edge of my ambition; if the vanity of rank, or the parade of representation had in my eyes such charms as could overpower my philosophy, I should at least teach my desires a subordination to the sentiments of Justice; at least command them to compare the merits of their claims with those of others, and be silent. If diplomatic promotion in this course of duty, be an advantage or a reward, and the occasion should occur, for bestowing it, The United States besides all their deserving Citizens at home, have other Servants in Europe in the same Station with me older in years, more versed in public affairs, entitled by long and faithful service to the notice of public recompense; and without a delirium of extravagance could I expect advancement while they remain stationary? without an arrogance of equal injustice and absurdity could I wish it?\nThe situation at the Hague therefore, insignificant as it is satisfies me with an employment, which without being tedious or painful is adequate to my talents, and leaves me leisure to pursue any course of studies that may be recommended by its amusement or utility. Indeed Sir, it is a situation, in itself much preferable to that of eternal expectation in a lawyer’s office, for business which when it comes is scarcely sufficient to give bread, and procures one more curses than thanks. I may be reduced once more to the necessity of going through that trial, but as long as any other honest resource is left me, the remembrance of that probation will suffice me, and I shall not be willing to go through it again.\nAs I have known from the beginning your attachment to the idea of my returning to the Bar, and as I have never disguised to you the reluctance with which I should do it, I think it necessary candidly to acknowledge, that my feelings on this subject, become daily more strongly confirmed. I shall therefore always consider the bar as a resource, but I shall certainly consider it as the last.— As to affronts from my Countrymen, I am unwilling to anticipate what I hope I shall never deserve. But if destined to this mortification, I hope to be prepared to sustain it, and shall endeavour to meet it with the Spirit not barely of a Stoic, but of a Christian; not only with thefortitude to bear, but with the Charity to forgive. But situations like those here supposed require such efforts of extraordinary Virtue, that from diffidence of my own strength I hope not to be brought to the test. With respect to neglect, I do not fear it, because I am sure I shall never consider it as an evil. It has always been my opinion that the notice of the world is a thing to be commanded, but never solicited. The trifling portion of it that I have hitherto enjoyed, has come to me of its own accord, unexpected, and I can safely add undesired, though certainly received with pleasure. Upon this point, I think it in my power to speak with the more confidence, because I know perfectly well what it is to be neglected. I suffered it, for three long years, at my entrance into the world, when its effect was to leave even my subsistence dependent upon your kindness; and if I had not the magnanimity to endure it altogether without complaint, at least the idea never entered my head, of blaming the public for not giving me more confidence.\nI am ashamed of perceiving what a letter I have here written upon the single subject of myself. It will not however be uninteresting to parental kindness. But as it could only bear the appearance of foolish or affected Vanity to any less indulgent reader, I request particularly that it may be seen only by my mother and yourself. I will therefore mingle nothing more worthy of other perusal with it, but conclude with the usual assurance of unalterable affection from your Son\nJohn Q. Adams."

I was not acquainted with that circumstance till the commencement of this year, when Judge Woodward of Michigan delivered to me the collector’s accounts for the second quarter of 1805, schedules of bonds take[n] for duties in July and August of the same year, a general account current embracing all his transactions to the end of the year 1804 & including his receipts during 1805, with sundry explanatory statements. Those documents, unaccompanied with any letter to this Department, had been enclosed in a letter of Mr. Duncan to Judge Woodward, in which he stated that the accounts were duplicates which he was sending because the receipt of the original accounts had not been acknowledged. Upon enquiry I found that such accounts had not been received, nor indeed any communication whatever from his office relative to the transactions of the year 1805. The accounts for the year 1804 had been received. Before the accounts were delivered to the accounting officers, to whom they ought to have been transmitted directly, I exmined the general account current, and found that he acknowledged a balance due to the United States of Drs. 6,050.65, (exclusively of the duties accrued in 1805 & which exceed 40,000 dollars) and charged them with bills amounting to Drs. 25,232.09, drawn in payment of duties by Canadian merchants on sundry merchants of New York. As these bills had not been received at the Treasury, the letter, of which copy is enclosed, was immediately written to him, requesting him to state when & how they had been transmitted, and directing him to pay any balance in his hands in the Bank of the United States. Fearing that the bills might have fallen in improper hands, I wrote by next mail to the cashier of the Branch Bank of New York a letter, of which copy is also enclosed, requesting him to enquire whether the bills had been presented for payment, and received the answer, copy of which is also enclosed; by which I learnt with astonishment that the bills had been presented by Mr. Duncan himself, and that he had received payment on the 30th Nover. last. His departure from Michillimakinac, his receiving the amount of the bills, and his concealment of that transaction as well as his continued silence, (for no answer has been received to the letters of 3d instt.) so clearly evinced a premeditated plan to receive and retain the public monies that I gave directions for having his accounts settled and a suit to be immediately instituted. I now lay the facts before you, and respectively submit the propriety of an immediate removal from office. It has not been usual to institute suits against delinquent officers without previously removing them; and, in this instance, if he has left the uncollected bonds with a deputy at Michillimakinac, there is a hope that a successor may, by an early application obtain them.\nIt is proper to add that in the case of the seizure of goods belonging to the North west company, complained of by the British Minister; on which subject I also wrote to the collector a letter which remains unanswered, I am informed by Judge Woodward that, as late as September last when he left Detroit in company with Mr. Duncan, the goods had not been libelled nor any suit instituted by the Collector: an omission for which I cannot account, which causes a delay oppressive to the parties, and may ultimately, in case of waste or damage, expose the United States to a just reclamation for the injury sustained.\nI have the honor to be with the highest respect Sir Your most obedt.

Mr Henry Wyld from the Neighbourhood of Manchester waited upon you, respecting the emigration of himself, and a Number of his friends to the State of Pensilvania; at the same time he presented a Note from me, design’d to aid his introduction to You.\nWe are all getting ready as fast as Possible, and purpose to go for Liverpool about the 20th of next Month in order to proceed according to your directions—and they write me, to request the Promised Protections may be sent to my care with all convenient speed for the Persons Named in their Proposals. Also for Myself and two sons—John 21 Years & Richard 19 Years of Age.— Another for John Billington and Ann His Wife with a child of 2 Years old— If it be in due order about 10 more not fill’d up for Persons, who are as yet uncertain, as to taking this Opportunity of going with us.\nWe are amply provided with all kinds of Models for the perfecting of our Purpose when we arrive at the much Longed for Country— Which if it please God to grant, in his good Providence— We have not the least doubt of Joining all the Manufactories of Spitalfields & Manchester together, in the most Perfect manner, as far as circumstances will admitt.\nIt will be our highest Worldly Glory to contribute all we are able to the internal riches of a rising Empire, that expected Prosperity animates our minds more than Private advantage.\nI am greatly at a loss for the knowledge of the dift. kinds of Silks Produced in N. America & the Prices they are respectively worth in that Country I beg that information from you with samples—for I can get no acct here but what is very contradictory.\nI should have wrote, on Mr Wylds return, but delay’d in hopes of being able to wait upon you myself— For I own I am affraid of Speaking my mind by Letter— But as the undertaking is of such extent I am very anxious that nothing be omitted.\nIf you have a trusty friend here, to whom I might fully openmy mind, I beg to have us brot together for there are very many things, which I’m affraid to mention by Letter, which I wish you to be well acquainted with.\nIt is my wish, if you Judge it right to take some Chains of Silk Handkercheifs that is Webbs unwoven and Shute, or Weft for them ready Prepared so as to be able at our Arrival to go to Work without loss of time, but in this I wait to be govern’d by your direction.\nI have my fears respecting that part of our Utencils called Reeds being to be got in that Country, that may be fine enough for the Silk business, If that was known to be the Case we would try to get some ready made ones over with us—but the Laws make it very dangerous to attempt such a thing— The Company have wrote me by all means to see Mr Laurens, I have applied at Mr Mannings but have not seen him as he was at that time gone out of Town.\nYou may be assured Sir that a Person of Your eminence & Political principals stands very high in our esteem and if the time should ever arrive that we may have your Visits to see our Works in the much desired Country we shall much rejoice— In the mean time hope, thro’ Your recommendations to meet with that Countenance which We shall endeavour to merit— Therefore entreat Your Letters for that Purpose— Mr Wyld has not in the course of his correspondance, told me wether you knew the Precise time fix’d for our setting out. But the Change of Men & We hope of Measures in this Government make us wish to be gone sooner than the 20th of May if it can be done. Please therefore to expedite all your directions to me as soon as Possible. As Mr Hodson very kindly takes the sending of this under his care I am more easy about its coming safe— I should hope he will not take it amiss if you return Your ansr by the same Channel of conveyance— Mr Wyld told me you would send a Special Messenger over when all things were ready— My Country frds have sold the Cattle & are making a full end of their affairs, and it is our earnest wish that we may not have to wait long for the Ship— I am With the highest esteem Your Excellencys most obedient & very Humble servant\nEdmund Clegg\nP.S.If we arrive Safe on the Continent a great Number more ofusefull hands intend to follow us—and we have hitherto none but Religious, Sober Moral Persons\nHis Excellency B Franklin LLD &c &c"

    "content": "Poplar Forest. Nov. 25. 16.\nI recieve here, dear Sir, your favor of the 4th. just as I am preparing my return to Monticello for winter quarters; and I hasten to answer to some of your enquiries. the Tracy I mentioned to you is the one connected by marriage with La Fayette’s family. the mail which brought your letter brought one also from him. he writes me that he is become blind & so infirm that he is no longer able to compose any thing. so that we are to consider his works as now closed. they are 3. vols of Ideology. 1 on political economy. 1. on Ethics, and 1. containing his Commentary on <[. . .]> Montesquieu, and a little tract on education. altho’ his Commentary explains his principles of government, he had intended to have substituted for it an elementary and regular treatise on the subject: but he is prevented by his infirmities. his Analyse de Dupuys he does not avow.\nMy books are all arrived, some at New York, some at Boston; and I am glad to hear that those for Harvard are safe also; and the Uranologia you mention, without telling me what it is. it is something good, I am sure, from the name connected with it, and if you would add to it your Fable of the bees, we should recieve valuable instruction as to the Uranologia both of the father & son; more valuable than the Chinese will from our bible-societies. these Incendiaries, finding that the days of fire and faggot are over in the Atlantic hemisphere, are now preparing to put the torch to the Asiatic regions. what would they say were the Pope to send annually to this country colonies of Jesuit priests with cargoes of their Missal and translations of their Vulgate, to be put gratis into the hands of every one who would accept them? and to act thus nationally on us as a nation?\nI proceed to the letter you were so good as to inclose to me. it is an able letter, speaks volumes in few words, presents a profound view of awful truths, and lets us see truths more awful, which are still to follow. George the IIId. then, and his minister Pitt, and successors, have spent the fee-simple of the kingdom, under pretence of governing it. their sinecures, salaries, pensions, priests, prelates, princes and eternal wars have mortgaged to it’s full value the last foot of their soil. they are reduced to the dilemma of a bankrupt spendthrift who, having run thro’ his whole fortune, now asks himself what he is to do? it is in vain he dismisses his coaches and horses, his grooms, liveries, cooks and butlers. this done, he still finds he has nothing to eat. what was his property, is now that of his creditors. if still in his hands, it is only as their trustee. to them it belongs, & to them every farthing of it’s profits must go. the reformation of extravagancies comes too late. all is gone. nothing left for retrenchment or frugality to go on. the debts of England however, being due from the whole nation, to one half of it, being as much the debt of the creditor as debtor, if it could be referred to a court of Equity, principles might be devised to adjust it peaceably. dismiss their parasites, ship off their paupers to this country, let the landholders give half their lands to the moneylenders, & these last relinquish one half of their debts. they would still have a fertile island, a sound and effective population to labor it, and would hold that station among political powers, to which their natural resources and faculties entitle them. they would no longer indeed be the lords of the ocean, and paymasters of all the princes of the earth. they would no longer enjoy the luxuries of pyrating and plundering every thing by sea, and of bribing and corrupting every thing by land; but they might enjoy the more safe and lasting luxury of living on terms of equality, justice and good neighborhood with all nations. As it is, their first efforts will probably be to quiet things awhile by the palliatives of reformation; to nibble a little at pensions and sinecures; to bite off a bit here, and a bit there to amuse the people; and to keep the government agoing by encroachments on the interest of the public debt, 1. percent of which, for instance, witheld, gives them a spare revenue of 10 millions for present subsistence, and spunges in fact 200. millions of the debt. this remedy they may endeavor to administer in broken doses of a small pill at a time. the first may not occasion more than a strong Nausea in the moneylenders; but the 2d will probably produce a revulsion of the stomach, borborisms, and spasmodic calls for fair settlement and compromise. but it is not in the character of man to come to any peaceable compromise of such a state of things. the princes & priests will hold to the flesh-pots, the empty bellies will seize on them, & these being the multitude, the issue is obvious, civil war, massacre, exile as in France, until the stage is cleared of every thing but the multitude, and the lands get into their hands by such processes as the revolution will engender. they will then want peace and a government, and what will it be? certainly not a renewal of that which has already ruined them. their habits of law & order, their ideas almost innate of the vital <principles> elements of free government, of trial by jury, habeas corpus, freedom of the press, freedom of opinion, and representative government, make them, I think, capable of bearing a considerable portion of liberty. they will probably turn their eyes to us, and be disposed to tread in our footsteps, seeing how safely these have led us into port. there is no part of our model to which they seem unequal, unless perhaps the elective presidency; and even that might possibly be rescued from the tumult of elections, by subdividing the electoral assemblages, into very small parts, such as of wards or townships, and making them simultaneous. but you know them so much better than I do, that it is presumption to offer my conjectures to you.\nWhile it is much our interest to see this power reduced from it’s towering & borrowed height, to within the limits of it’s natural resources, it is by no means our interest that she should be brought below that, or lose her competent place among the nations of Europe. the present exhausted state of the continent will, I hope, permit them to go through their struggle without foreign interference, and to settle their new government according to their own will. I think it will be friendly to us, as the nation itself would be were it not artfully wrought up by the hatred their government bears us. and were they once under a government which should treat us with justice & equality I should myself feel with great strength the ties which bind us together, of origin, language, laws and manners: and I am persuaded the two people would become in future, as it was with the antient Greeks, among whom it was reproachful for Greek to be found fighting against Greek in a foreign army. the individuals of the nation I have ever honored and esteemed, the basis of their character being essentially worthy: but I consider their government as the most flagitious which has existed since the days of Philip of Macedon, whom they make their model. it is not only founded in corruption itself, but insinuates the same poison into the bowels of every other, corrupts it’s councils, nourishes factions, stirs up revolutions, and places it’s own happiness in fomenting commotions and civil wars among others, thus rendering itself truly the hostis humani generis. the <principle> effect is now coming home to itself. it’s first operation will fall on the individuals who have been <practising> the chief instruments in it’s corruptions, and will eradicate the families which have, from generation to generation been fattening on the blood of their brethren: and this scoria once thrown off, I am in hopes a purer nation will result, and a purer government be instituted, one which, instead of endeavoring to make us their natural enemies, will see in us, what we really are, their natural friends and brethren, and more interested in a fraternal connection with them than with any other nation on earth. I look therefore to their revolution with great interest. I wish it to be as moderate & bloodless, as will effect the desired object of an honest government, one which will permit the world to live in peace, and under the bonds of friendship and good neighborhood.\nIn this tremendous tempest, the distinctions of whig & tory will disappear like chaff on a troubled ocean. indeed they have been disappearing from the day Hume first began to publish his history. this single book has done more to sap the free principles of the English <government> constitution than the largest standing army of which their patriots have been so jealous. it is like the portraits of our countryman Wright, whose eye was so unhappy as to sieze all the ugly features of his subject, and to present them faithfully; while it was entirely insensible to every lineament of beauty. so Hume has consecrated, in his fascinating style, all the arbitrary proceedings of the English kings, as <the> true evidences of the constitution, and glided over it’s whig principles as the unfounded pretensions of factious demagogues. he even boasts, in his life written by himself, that of the numerous alterations suggested by the readers of his work, he had never adopted one proposed by a whig.\nBut what, in this same tempest, will become of their colonies & their fleets? will the former assume independance, and the latter resort to pyracy for subsistence, taking possession of some island as a point d’appui? a pursuit of these would add too much to the speculations on the situation and prospects of England, into which I have been led by the pithy text of the letter you so kindly sent me, and which I now return. it is worthy the pen of Tacitus. I add therefore only my affectionate and respectful souvenirs to mrs Adams and yourself.\nTh: Jefferson"

I thought you expressed some dislike to a change of judicature, said you could not furnish then a correct statement of the prosecutions, but would do it afteryour return to the city. this at least was the impression left on my mind, and I ascribed your not having furnished so specific a list of the prosecutions as would enable me to interpose with due accuracy, either to the distance of the trials, or perhaps a willingness to meet the investigation before a jury summoned by an impartial officer. the trial on behalf of the Senate being postponed you have time to explain your wishes to me, and if it be done on a consultation with mr Dallas, it may abridge the operations which shall be thought proper.\nI accept with acknolegement mrs Bache’s compliments, & beg leave to tender her my sincere respects, & to yourself salutations & my best wishes.\nTh: Jefferson"

The question then depending respecting the place of meeting of the congress under the New government has I find been since decided in favor of New York and the different periods fixed for the States to give operation to the governmt. Although I am sensible the proceedings that have been had in Congress respecting the place where the first session should be held will make unfavourable impressions of the policy of the eastern states, yet when the nature ofthe question is considered some allowances should be made for local prejudices which more or less actuate all public bodies where the object is local. I confess I consider the agitation of the question by the present Congress as premature and tending to confirm the prejudices of those of the present body, who may become members of the new legislature and thereby introduce that warmth into the discussion of the question hereafter which I hoped would have been avoided. The decision for establishing the fœderal seat of government appears to me to have been more proper for the deliberations of the new than the old government and I am disposed to believe notwithstanding the probability of the State spirit being carried into the Senate that it will exist in a less degree than it has hitherto done in Congress as the members from each State are few and these it is to be presumed will be selected from the most enlightend and virtuous of their citizens, especially too when it is contemplated how great are the powers vested in that body. May not the legislatures of the states should they incline to do so choose the electors themselv[es] instead of refering the choice to the people. The words of the constitution are not so clear on that point as to restrain these public bodies from spurning the exercise of that power and we know all public bodies are but too apt to assume rather than relinquish power where by any construction of terms they may interpose authority.\nThere are I am told in the Fredericksburg goal two men confined and to undergo an examing court for altering the final settlements by extracting the ink or figures and inserting others to a much greater amount. Their names are I think Willet and Whitney. A third it is said was concerned with them who is gone off and I think named Grant. These men I hear have been in the eastern States practicing the same forjeries and impositions and that some of the certificates they had passed have been presented to the Treasury office in N. York and decided to be forjeries. It will I fear be difficult to prove the fact upon them so as to bring them to condemation. The nature of the offence is such as to be difficult of proof.

After my letter to you, which you made known to Col. Mercer, I wrote to Mr. Cabell in the mostdecidedterms, and he informs me he made the proper use of it. I have a letter from Col. Mercer also, corresponding doubtless with his to you. The awkwardness thrown upon us is much increased by the delay in giving the regular notice. To anticipate it might mark an unsuitable feeling of one sort, as well as a censure on the delay. To be silent too long, leaves room for inferences of another sort also to be avoided. The latter effect will however be corrected by our answers which seem to be sufficiently foretold; whilst there would be no opportunity of doing away the former. As there is a Resolution of the Convention, connecting with the notification copies of the proceedings which require some time for preparation, the delay of our answers ought to be accounted for by that circumstance. I hope your letter to Judge Brooke will put an end to the difficulty. Should his answer fail of doing so, be so good as to let me know it with your view of the course proper for us. Should it become necessary for us not to wait for the usual mode of notification, it may be a question, whether our answers requiring a nomination of others, might not most properly addressed to the Committee at Richmond which is to make it; bottoming them in that case on the expediency of an early notice to those who are to take our places.\nMy answer whenever & to whomever made will of course withdraw my name from the ticket; in stating the grounds for which I feel the delicacyof the task.

In answer thereto, I must observe, that the distance of the period at which the Baron arrived at York Town is such, as to make it difficult if not impossible for a person to be very particular or positive in the explanations requested; but the embarrassments which resulted at that time from the undisciplined state of our army, the joy that ensued on the arrival of so experienced & respectable an officer as the Baron, & the prospects afforded us by this event of soon having an army that could face the enemy, were circumstances in the progress of the war too important to be even at this late period, wholly forgot. As well as I can recollect, the committee who first conferred with the Baron, made a verbal or parole report, in addition to & explanatory of their written report. The Baron had in Europe, as well as subsequent to his arrival in America been informed of the dissatisfaction of the american officers at the introduction of foreign officers into our army, many of whom having been totally disqualified for the offices they filled, had produced in the army a general aversion to the appointment of such officers. He was likewise apprized of the jealousy that might prevail from any claim on his part of rank or emolument, & that his abilities would be of very little service to the army, unless he could prevent their viewing him in an insidious light, & establish himself in their love & confidence. The Baron also conducted himself as an officer having high ideas of honor, & an opinion, that it would be not only derogatory to his own reputation to make any pecuniary stipulations with Congress & thus to degrade himself to asoldier of fortune, but that it would derogate from the honor of Congress, as asovereignpower, to suppose such stipulations necessary for securing either their justice or generosity. For these reasons it appeared to me, & to such of the members of Congress as I then conferred with on the subject, that the committee had conducted properly in making the verbal report the substance of which has been communicated to Congress & is contained in the Baron’s printed statement of this matter. I shall only add, that I have always considered the United States, if the acts of the Congress at York town were binding on them, to be under obligations ofhonor, which should ever have more force than contracts not only to be just but generous towards the Baron, & to make ample provision for supporting him, as such an officer should be supported in Europe.\nI give you this information sir, with a reliance that you will not make any communication thereof to Congress, unless it is indispensibly necessary: because I am informed that in debating the matter a disposition has appeared in some Gentlemen not to give full credit to the certificates which the Baron has produced from a number of Gentlemen in support of his claim.\nI remain very respectfully Sir Your most hum sert\nE Gerry\nColonel Hamilton"

On hearing of his Death I thought of Nothing on the Subject but lending my Assistance from my own Resources towards the Support of that Part of the Family with whom I am connected. But it has been suggested to me that the Public may be well served, & some Provision ensured to the Family, if the Office were bestowed on Jonathan Smith the Son of the late Comissioner who will be assisted by a younger Brother. Both these have been in the Office many Years & are perfectly acquainted with the Business. They are both well known in the Treasury Department, Jonathan is near 30 years of Age & every Way qualified as to Abilities & Intigrity. The one who would assist him is equalled by very few young Men in a Multitude of Acquirements & excellent Qualities. I know that the Appointment would give great Pleasure to very many of the Citizens of this State who valued Mr Smith & deem him the Father of the Loan Office here, having brought it from small Beginnings, to extensive Usefulness, by his Address & great Attention—Private or compassionate Considerations I am well aware are only secondary in Affairs of public Duty. But they do not fail to have an Effect on the public Mind where the public Interest is also served. They have had their Influence on me, who have indeed only private Feelings as immediate Motives for giving you this Trouble. But no such Considerations would bias me if I were not firmly convinced that the Office would be betterexecuted by J. S. assisted as he will be, than by any other Person; as he has Capacity equal to any other & in Addition much Experience in the Bussiness. Having stated to you the Circumstances I leave to you, without Anxiety, the Result.

After deliberating about seven months they resolved that the honour of their country would be tarnished in their hands if they acted otherwise. They say I have detained them seven monthsfrom doingwhat they ought to have done at once.It isimpossibleto foresee the consequences of this measure which I sincerely regret but here nochange can be expected and of course if the same councils prevail in America the alliance is at an end not to count the other injuries we shall receive from the loss of this nationso preponderant as it is; with such valuable possessions in our seas.I do not know whether my functions are suspended—in any event I must wait the orders of our government. At this moment I receive a letter from Timothy in reply to my first on this subject addressed as from an overseer to the foreman of his gang ascribing(if not absolutely theexistence of any complaint to me)yet that it is altogether owing to my misconduct that it broke out since I had acknowledged a from him three months before which he says proved they had no right[to]complain—hence he concludes that I suppressed that luminous work.To this I have yet given no answer nor do I at present propose. It will occur to you that I could not defend the treaty till there was a charge brought against itand to preventwhich was always the object of my efforts.Delay therefore was always favorable. This letter corresponds so much with the publication in the New York paper that it tends to create a suspicion they were written by the same hand but these little Connecticut jockey trickswere too easily seen thro’ now a days to produce any effect.Poor Washington into what hands has he fallen.\nThe above is gone by another rout.\nI have seen authentic documents to provethat G. Morris is at Berlin negociating to engage that court to take part against Franceandthat he expends much money therein thatbusiness whichis concluded to be Britishmoney as he is concluded to be a British agent—from Berlin he proceeds to Vienna. I saw this in a letter from a Dutch agent at Berlin to a Dutch commissary here, respecting wh. however you shall hear from me again.\nThe French troops gain daily new victori[e]s in the empire, being now within two days march of Ratisbon: & the Austrians retreating. At Ratisbon it is said that the armies of Jourdan & Moreau are to meet, & according to the original plan of the campaign to proceed towards Vienna. With Spn. an alliance offensive & defensive is concluded, & wh. embarks her in the war of course agnst. Engld.; & Prussia it is thought inclines to the same scale, being the preponderating one, & with a view of lopping off something from the empire & making it her own: such as Hamburg &ca. It is believed to be in contemplation between this govt. & Spn. to unite Portugal to the latter, with a view of rescuing that country from the hands of the British. I do suspect that Louisiana belongs to France by secret articles in her late treaty with Spn. Thus you see to what a wonderful height the fortunes of this country have already risen,& promise still to rise, since the new govt. daily gains strength in the affection & confidence of the people, whilst the surrounding govts. are tottering & menac’d with a fall.\nSepr. 6. I just hear that the plan of seizing our vessels having Englh. propertywill be carried into effect and that Spain are likely to pursue the same policy—in truth if we do not change our councils we shall be in a terrible state.\nThe army of Jourdan pressing on Ratisbon inducd P. Charles to draw 25.000. men from that before Moreau to his, to oppose Jourdan, & wh. occasioned the latter to retreat abt. 30. miles, at wh. moment Moreau made a stroke at the other weakened army & routed it taking 2000. prisoners & killing many. ’Tis said Jourdan is agn. on the offensive. His loss is not known in the retreat, but not deemed considerable.In publishing my correspondenceif that is thought adviseable,would you publish my private letter also to Randolphwh. you have seen.\n16. Bounaparte has gained another considerable victory near Trent, taking 5000 prisoners —Moreau has also gained one of some importance. Jourdan it is said wearied out with fatigue asks repose, & that Bournonville will replace him."

But before you deposit it, I hope you will find time and inclination to examine this child of my old age, to see if it be fit to enter it. After long gestation it has been brought forth with pains and labour, whichJuniussays in his celebrated Letter to the King increases maternal fondness. While reading it I hope you will bear in mind the motto in my title page.\nYou may discover in the preface that I, by no means, meant to restrain my pen to the mere question of theauthorshipofJunius; and this avowal allowed me to indulge the garullity of old age. My great aim has been to make a book replete with American principles, and by stating thegreat questionbetween Britain and her colonies, give our young men the information they lack: I have accordingly held upSamuel Adamsas the early file-leader of our revolution The most active men now on the stage in Boston, even his own grandchildren have read my notices of that great man with surprize. Has any one before me treated freely the character and policy of George the Third towards the colonies, and towards his own subjects?\nInstead of atempting merely to disentangle an artfully complicated knot I have actually made use of that popular question to induce Curiosity to read & reflect on a portion of our history, and on certain distinguished characters little known to the present generation. I may have overloaded my book with remarks and personal sketches; but having much to say, and but little time to say it in, I resolved to write a book with the freedom of Montaigne, and thatJunius, aliasChathamshould rise naturally out of my dramatical–history, and finally, I have closed with the catastrophe of the deluded monarch, and the triumph of America as illustrated in the royal introductory audience of our minister with our former King: and having done my best I am now amibitious of the approbation of such characters as Mr Madison.\nPlease to present my best regards to Mrs Madison. With a high degree of respect I remain your obt. servant\nBenjamin Waterhouse"

I putthe advertisementthreetimesat a week’s interval in the Democratic Press, and in like manner in Poulson’s daily advertiser.\nA fortnight ago dating from yesterday, I was attacked with pleurisy which has confined me to my chamber from that day to this, andpromises to keep me up stairs a week longer. But by dint of repeated bleedings, blisters, &c &c I may now be considered as convalescent. I shall attend to your directions respecting the Stoves and the Seal, whenever my health will permit me to leave the house.\nI sent yesterday forMrSlack, & persuaded him to take his chance by commencing a Grammar School at Charlotte’s ville. But I consider him as well qualified as any fresh imported tutor you are likely to procure from Europe, for the higher Situation; and not the worse for having spent a year or two in this country. He promises to be at Charlotte’s ville on the first day of next May, & that he will without delay,write to youto that purpose. If you are determined to send to Europe, pray confine yourself to Oxford, to escape the dialect of the scotch & the brogue of theIrish.Nor is there equal classicaltasteelsewhere.\nHad the proposals of the Visitors of the University been immediate, they are so reasonable as to induce me to accept of them; but if I am to be bound for a twelve month without compensation, it paralyzes my engagements during the intermediate time. For instance, since I turned over this page, a MrWebster has applied to me from a Company of Booksellers to edit a selection of common law reports from the mass of english common law reporters, rejecting cases not adapted to American courts, so as to reduce the Mass of Reporters to about a third of the present price. They require I shall furnish a volume every two months till compleated: I have requested time, that I may see how I can undertake this, consistently with my wish of going to your University. If I accept of it, I must give my name & relinquish the compensation of the latter volumes to some one who will compleat it under my directions.\nI have another proposal to edit an agricultural dictionary in ten 8vovolumes at the same rate of publication, but on terms not so advantageous in point of profit. If I accept your offer, I must take the last in preference, because I can execute it within the limits of my time.\nHowever, the terms proposed to mefrom your Institution, are too liberal not to induce me to make efforts to accept of them; and I shall certainly endeavour to modify my engagements here so as not to interfere with mypresent intentionsof meeting you a twelve month hence at Charlottes ville. But if I must remain here, whether for a longer or a shorter time, I must maintain myself here; and my future intentions must be modified by what necessity requires at present. If I hesitate therefore to accept Your proposals at once, the distant period of the proposals forces uncertainty upon me.\nI will attend to all the other wants of your Institution, as soon as returning health, and a little leisure will permit me.\nThomas Cooper"

Varnum’s complaint transm[itte]d in that of the 3d, is very different from what he expected or I immagined it would be from his state of the case—Whether It is right or wrong, It is not in my power to determine, as the Evidence which was before them is not Inserted in the proceedings, which ought to have been, as I at this distance can have no other means to warrant me, either in confirming or rejecting the Sentence—I cannot but add that It seems extraordinary to me and exceedingly strange, that Captn Lane should have been at so much trouble and expence to get the men without having a right to ’em—For which reason, to discountenance a practice extremely pernicious in Its nature, of one Officer trying to take away & seduce the men of another and on account of the Imperfection in the proceedings in not stating the matter fully & the whole evidence; The Complaint should bereheard and every thing appertaining to It, the manner of Inlistment &c. particularly specified for me to found my Judgemt on.\nThe Arms &c. which you sent to Norwich, as mentioned in the Invoice contained in that of the 6th are not arrived—The number of Carbines is only half of what Genl Putnam wrote for as I have been Informed, and It is less by three hundred than I directed to be sent in my Letter from Philadelphia of the 28 Ulto. This I suppose had not come to hand when you wrote, as you have not acknowledged the receipt of It.\nI have Inclosed two Letters for Majr Small & Chs Proctor Esqr. supposed to be at Hallifax which being wrote with a design to procure the inlargement of Capn Proctor a prisoner on board the Mercury man of War or Induce them to Intercede for a more humane Treatment to be shewn him, I request you to forward by the first Opportunity by way of Nova Scotia.\nI am this moment favoured with yours of the 9 Inst. advising me of the Capture made by our Armed Vessells of one of the Transports with a Company of Highlanders on board—and I flatter myself If our Vessells keep a good look out, as the whole Fleet are bound to Boston which sailed with her, that more of them will fall into our hands—This is a further proof that Governmt expected Genl Howe was still in Boston.\nI am extremely sorry that your health is more & more impaired and having heard by a Letter from Col. Hancock that Mr Whitcombe, Col. Whitcomb’s Brother, is appointed a Brigr Genl, I shall order him to relieve you as soon as I am informed that he accepts his Commission and If he does you may immediately call [him] to your assistance before I am certified of his acceptance, this will ease you of some trouble ’till I can regulate a few matters of Importance here which I hope to do in a little time.\nG.W."

I can readily suppose that the disapprobation expressed to you by one gentleman of the scurrilities of their papers must be sincere in those who have good sense & moderation of temper. but that it is not general is proved by the continuance of those scurrilities. the editors are but cooks who must consult the palates of their customers. thetoastsgiven at the fête with which mrKingwas complimented shew the spirit of a high-figuring portion of the party, and have sealed the decree which places him for ever in private life. if the federalists would have been contented with my giving a very moderate participation in office to those who had been totally excluded, I had hoped to have been able to effect a reconciliation, & would sincerely have attempted it. but they spurned every overture of conciliation.

I pitied your probable situation in the tempestuous season which immediately succeeded your departure. It is now above a fortnight since we should have met, and six states only appear. We have some hopes of Rhodeisland coming in to-day, but when two more will be added seems as insusceptible of calculation as when the next earthquake will happen. We have at length received the Definitive treaty with a joint letter from all our Commissioners. Not a tittle is changed in the treaty but the preamble and some small things which were of course. The Commissioners write that the riot of Philadelphia and departure of Congress thence made the most serious impressions in Europe, and have excited great doubts of the stability of our confederacy, and in what we shall end. The accounts were greatly exaggerated, and it is suspected that Gr. Br. wished to sign no treaty.\nYou have seen G.M. [George Mason] I hope and had much conversation with him. What are his sentiments as to the amendment of our constitution? What amendments would he approve? Is he determined to sleep on, or will he rouze and be active? I wish to hear from you on this subject, and at all times on any others which occupy your thoughts. I see Bradford advertises Smith’s history of N. York. As I mean to write for one for myself, andthink I heard you say you had it not, I shall add one for you. Our news from the good family we left is not agreeable. Mrs. Trist is much agitated by the doubts and difficulties which hang over her and impede her reunion with Mr. Trist. They are without lodgers except those we left there, and the ladies we left there propose soon to depart.

    "content": "Department of StateMay 17th. 1806.\nGentlemen,\nI herewith inclose a Commission and letters of Credence authorizing you to treat with the British Government concerning the maritime wrongs which have been committed, and the regulation of Commerce and navigation, between the parties. Your authority is made several as well as joint, as a provision for any contingency depriving either of the co-operation of the other.\nThe importance of the trust is evinced by its being made the occasion of an extraordinary mission, as well as by the subjects which it embraces. And I have great pleasure in expressing the confidence which the President feels in the prudence and talents to which the business is committed.\nIt is his particular wish that the British Government should be made fully to understand, that the United States are sincerely and anxiously disposed to cherish good will and liberal intercourse between the two nations, that an unwillingness alone to take measures not congenial with that disposition has made them so long patient under violations of their rights and of the rules of a friendly reciprocity, and that when forced at length by accumulating wrongs to depart from an absolute forbearance, they have not only selected a mode strictly pacific, but in demonstration of their friendly policy, have connected with the measure, an extraordinary mission, with powers to remove every source of difference, and even to enlarge the foundations of future harmony and mutual interest.\nThere can be the less ground of umbrage to the British Government in the act prohibiting the importation of certain articles of British manufacture, 1. because there is nothing in the face of the Act beyond a mere Commercial regulation, tending to foster manufactures in the United States, to lessen our dependence on a single nation by a distribution of our trade, and to substitute for woolens and linens, manufactures made from one of our principal agricultural Staples, 2. because it is far short of a reciprocity with British exclusions of American articles of export, 3. because as a Commercial measure discriminating in time of war, between British and other nations, it has examples in British practice. It deserves attention also that a discrimination was made, and under another name, still exists in the amount of convoy duty imposed on the trade between Great Britain with Europe, and with America, 4. because the measure can not be ascribed to a partiality towards the enemies of Great Britain, or to a view of favoring them in the war; having for its sole object the interest of the United States, which it pursues in a mode strictly conformable to the rights and the practice of all Nations.\nTo observations of this kind it may be useful to add that the measure was undertaken before the late change in the British Ministry, and does not therefore imply any particular distrust of the views of the new one; but merely a belief that it was most consistent with self respect not to be diverted, by an occurrence of that nature, from a ground which had been deliberately and publicly assumed; not to mention that no assurances sufficiently decisive had been received, that a disposition to correct the evils in question predominated in the present Cabinet; whilst it was known that some of its most distinguished members have heretofore been among the warmest champions of the maritime doctrines in which those evils have their origin.\nIn one respect the act may even be favorable to the objects of the present Cabinet, if it should be disposed to make unpopular concessions refused by their predecessors; since concessions alone can now regain a lost market for certain important and popular classes of British manufactures.\nIn fine the Act may truly be represented as so far from derogating from the amicable dispositions of the United States towards Great Britain, that it has resulted solely from the inefficacy of their protracted and reiterated endeavors otherwise to obtain a just redress, and from a hope that an appeal, in this peaceable form, to the reflections and interest of an enlightened nation, would be more successful in removing every obstacle to a perfect and permanent cordiality between the two nations.\nThe instructions given to Mr. Monroe January 5th. 1804, having taken into view, and being still applicable to, a great proportion of the matter now committed to your joint negotiations, it will be most convenient to referyou to those instructions, as your general guide; and to confine the present, to the alterations and additions which a change of circumstances, or a contemplation of new objects may require.\nThe first article of the project comprized in the instructions of 1804, relates to the impressment of Seamen. The importance of an effectual remedy for this practice derives urgency from the licenciousness with which it is still pursued, and from the growing impatience of this Country under it. So indispensable is some adequate provision for the case, that the President makes it a necessary preliminary to any stipulation requiring a repeal of the Act shutting the market of the United States against certain British manufactures. At the same time he authorizes you, in case the ultimatum as stated in the Article above referred to, should not be acceptable to the British Government, to substitute one in the terms following. “No Seaman nor Sea-faring person shall upon the high Seas, and without the jurisdiction of either party, be demanded or taken out of any Ship or Vessel, belonging to the Citizens or Subjects of one of the parties, by the public or private armed Ships or men of war belonging to or in the service of the other party: and strict orders shall be given for the due observance of this engagement.”\nAn article in these terms was, with the acquiescence of Lord Hawkesbury and Mr. Addington, concerted between Mr. King and Ld. St. Vincents, on the approaching renewal of the late war: It was frustrated by an exception of the narrow Seas inserted by Lord St. Vincents; an exception so evidently inadmissible both in principle and in practice, that it must have been intended as a pretext for evading the stipulation at that time. Perhaps the present Ministry may neither be disposed to resort to such a pretext, nor unwilling to avail themselves of the precise sanction, as far as it was given, by their predecessors.\nWith respect to contraband which is the subject of the 4th. Article, it may be observed that as it excludes naval stores from the list, and is otherwise limited to articles strictly military, it must if admissible to Great Britain, leave but feeble objections to an abolition of contraband altogether. In the present state of the arts in Europe, with the intercourse by land, no nation at war with Great Britain can be much embarrassed by leaving those particular articles subject to maritime capture. Whilst belligerent nations therefore have little interest in the limited right against contraband, it imposes on neutrals all the evils resulting from suspicions and vexatious searches, and from questions incident to the terms used in the actual enumeration. It is not an unreasonable hope therefore, that in place of this article, an entire abolition of contraband may be substituted. Should this be found unattainable, it may be an improvement of the Article as it stands, to subjoin, for the sake of greater caution, to the positive enumeration, a negative specification of certain articles, such as provisions, money, naval Stores &c, as in no case to be deemed within the meaning of the article; with a proviso, that thespecification shall not be construed to imply in the least, that any article not specified in the exception, shall, on that account, be liable to be drawn into question.\nA doctrine has been latterly introduced by the British Courts and at length adopted by the instructions of June 1803, to British Cruisers, which regards contraband conveyed in one voyage as affecting a resumed or a return voyage, although the contraband shall have been previously deposited at its port of destination. It will be a further improvement of the article, to insert a declaratory clause against this innovation and the abuses incident to it.\nThe 4th. Article, besides the stipulation on the subject of contraband, relates to two other Subjects; 1. that of free Ships free goods, 2. that of a trade with enemies Colonies.\n1. With respect to the first, the principle that a neutral flag covers the property of an enemy, is relinquished, in pursuance of the example of the Russian Treaty, on which the article is modelled; the relinquishment however being connected with and conditioned on, the provision required in favor of the neutral right to the Colonial Trade. The importance of that principle to the security of neutral Commerce, and to the freedom of the Seas, has at all times been felt by the United States; and although they have not asserted it as the established law of Nations, they have ever been anxious to see it made a part of that law. It was with reluctance of course that a contrary stipulation was authorized, and merely as a mean of obtaining from Great Britain the recognition of a principle now become of more importance to neutral nations possessing mercantile Capital, than the principle of “free Ships free goods.” It is to be particularly kept in view therefore that such a contrary stipulation is to be avoided if possible; and, if unavoidable, that the stipulation be so modified as to interfere as little as possible with the spirit and policy of any provisions in favor of the principle which may be likely to be introduced into a treaty of peace among the present belligerent powers of Europe. Should it be known that Russia, as well as France, means to insist on such a provision, and that such a stipulation by the United States, however modified, will materially affect her confidence and good will towards them, the objection to the measure will acquire a force that can yield only to the consideration that without such a sacrifice the provisions for the security of our Seamen, and of our neutral commerce can not be obtained, and that the sacrifice will effectually answer those purposes. 2. The vast importance of the Colonial Trade, with the circumstances and the excitement which have taken place since the date of the original instructions to Mr. Monroe, will require that the neutral right on this subject be provided for in an appropriate article, and in terms more explicit than are used in the article under review. As the right in this case, turns on the general principle, that neutrals may lawfully trade, with theexceptions of blockades and contraband, to and between all ports of an enemy, and in all articles, although the trade shall not have been open to them in time of peace, particular care is to be taken, that no part of the principle be expressly or virtually abandoned, as being no part of the law of nations. On the contrary it is much to be desired that the general principle in its full extent, be laid down in the stipulation; but as this may not be attainable and as too much ought not to be risked by an inflexible pursuit of abstract right, especially, against the example and the sentiments of great powers having concurrent interests with the United States; you are left at liberty, if found necessary, to abridge the right in practice, as it is done in the supplement of October 1801, to the treaty of June of that year, between Russia and Great Britain; not omitting to provide that in case Great Britain should by her Treaties or instructions leave to any other nation the right in a greater extent than it is stipulated to the United States, they may claim the enjoyment of it in an equal extent.\nThe abuses which have been committed by Great Britain under the pretext that a neutral trade, from enemy Colonies, through neutral ports, was a direct trade, render it indispen[s]able to guard against such a pretext by some express declaration on that point. The most that can be conceded on the part of the United States is, thatthe landing of the goods, the securing the duties, and the change of the Ship, or preferably, the landing of the goods alone, or with the securing the duties, shall be requisite to destroy the identity of the voyage and the directness of the trade; and that the ordinary documents of the Custom House Officers, shall be sufficient evidence of the facts or fact.\nA satisfactory provision on this subject of a trade with enemy Colonies, is deemed of so much consequence to the rights and interests of the United States, and is so well understood to have been contemplated along with a like provision against the impressment of Seamen, in the late act of Congress prohibiting the importation of certain classes of British manufactures, that, as was enjoined with respect to the provision against impressment, no stipulation is to be entered into not consistent with a continuance of that Act, unless the provision with respect to the Colonial trade be also obtained.\nIn remodelling the provision with respect to the Colonial Trade, you may with great propriety urge the distinction between the West India Colonies, and the very distant ones in the East Indies and elsewhere; and the reasonableness of limiting to the former, the exception of the direct trade with their parent Countries, out of the general neutral right. The distinction is supported by several considerations, particula[r]ly by the greater difficulty, in the case of the more distant Colonies, of previously knowing, and eventually proving, the regulations as they may have actually stood in time of peace, and by the ruinous delays and expences attending the judicialinvestigations. The British Courts have in fact admitted the distinction so far as to presume the lawfulness of the neutral trade with the East India Colonies, as being generally open in peace as well as war; whilst they reverse the presumption with respect to the West Indies.\nIn addition to what is proposed on the subject of blockades in VI and VII. articles, the perseverance of Great Britain in considering a notification of a blockade, even of an intended blockade, to a foreign Government, or its Minister at London, as a notice to its Citizens, and as rendering a Vessel wherever found, in a destination to the notified Port as liable to Capture, calls for a special remedy. The palpable injustice of the practice, is aggravated by the auxiliary rule prevailing in the British Courts, that the blockade is to be held in legal force, until the Governmental notification be expressly ⟨resc⟩inded, however certain the fact may be that the blockade was never formed or had ceased. You will be at no loss for topics to enforce the inconsistency of these innovations with the law of nations, with the nature of blockades, with the safety of neutral commerce; and particularly with the communication made to this Government, by order of the British Government in the year 1804; according to which the British Commanders and Vice Admiralty Courts were instructed, “not to consider any blockade of the Islands of Martinique and Guadaloupe as existing unless in respect of particular ports, which may be actually invested, and then not to capture Vessels bound to such ports, unless they shall previously have been warned not to enter them.”\nThe absurdity of substituting such Diplomatic notifications in place of a special warning from the blockading Ships, cannot be better illustrated than by the fact, that before the notification of a proposed blockade of Cadiz in the year 1805 was received here from our Minister at London, official information was received from Cadiz, that the blockade had actually been raised, by an enemy’s fleet.\nIt may be worth your attention, that a distinction has been admitted, by the British prize Courts in consideration of the distance of the United States from the European blockades, between their Citizens and those of States less distant, the notice required for the former being more positive than is made necessary for the latter. You will be able to avail yourselves in the discussion, and perhaps in the modification of the article, of the reasons on which such a distinction rests.\nThe instructions in the hands of Mr. Monroe are silent with respect to convoys. If the footing on which the neutral right on that subject is placed by the Russian and British Treaty of 1801, can be turned to advantage in your negotiations, and should be understood to coincide with the present way of thinking of Russia and other maritime powers, an article corresponding with the regulations in that Treaty, may be admitted. But as the United States are not in the practice of convoying their trade, nor arelikely to be so within the period of any stipulation now to be made, and as the progress of opinion is rather favorable than discouraging to the enlargement of neutral rights, it is not, in a general view, desireable that any stipulation, such as Great Britain will probably admit, should at this time be entered into. In whatever arrangement on the subject, limiting the protecting right of public Ships of war, may be deemed expedient, you will be careful so to express the limitation, that it may be applied to theexerciseof the right, without affecting theabstract rightitself.\nThere remains, as an object of great importance, some adequate provision against the insults and injuries committed by British Cruisers in the vicinity of our Shores and harbours. These have been heretofore a topic of remonstrance, and have in a late instance, been repeated with circumstances peculiarly provoking, as they include the murder of an American Seaman within the jurisdictional limits of the United States. Mr. Monroe is in full possession of the documents explaining a former instance. Herewith will be received, those relating to the late one. They not only support a just demand of an exemplary punishment of the Offenders, and of indemnity for the spoliations, but call for some stipulations guarding against such outrages in future. With this view it is proper that all armed belligerent Ships should be expressly and effectually restrained from making seizures or searches, within a certain distance from our Coasts, or taking stations near our harbours commodious for those purposes.\nIn defining the distance protected against belligerent proceedings, it would not perhaps be unreasonable, considering the extent of the United States; the shoalness of their coast, and the natural indication furnished by the well defined path of the Gulf stream, to expect an immunity for the space between that limit and the American Shore. But at least it may be insisted that the extent of the neutral immunity should correspond with the claims maintained by Great Britain, around her own territory. Without any particular enquiry into the extent of these, it may be observed, 1. that the British Act of Parliament in the year 1736. 9G. 2. C. 35. supposed to be that called the Hovering Act assumes for certain purposes of Trade, the distance of four leagues from the Shores, 2. That it appears both in the Reign of James I. and of Charles II, the security of the Commerce with British Ports, was provided for by express prohibitions against the roving or hovering of belligerent ships so near the neutral harbours and Coasts of Great Britain as to disturb or threaten Vessels homeward or outward bound; as well as against belligerent proceedings, generally, within an inconvenient approach towards British Territory.\nWith this example, and with a view to what is suggested by our own experience, it may be expected that the British Government will not refuse to concur in an article to the following effect.\n“It is agreed that all armed Vessels belonging to either of the parties engaged in war shall be effectually restrained by positive orders and penal provisions from seizing, searching or otherwise interrupting or disturbing vessels to whomsoever belonging & whether outward or inward bound, within the Harbours, or the chambers formed by head-lands, or any where at Sea within the distance of four leagues from the shore, or from a right line from one head land to another. It is further agreed that by like orders and provisions all armed Vessels shall be effectually restrained by the party to which they respectively belong, from stationing themselves, or from roving or hovering so near the entry of any of the harbours or Coasts of the other, as that Merchantmen shall apprehend their passage to be unsafe, or a danger of being set upon and surprized; and that in all cases where death shall be occasioned by any proceeding contrary to these stipulations, and the offender cannot be conveniently brought to trial and punishment under the laws of the party offended, he shall on demand made within months be delivered up for that purpose.”\nIf the distance of four leagues cannot be obtained, any distance not less than one sea league may be substituted in the article. It will occur to you that the stipulation against the roving and hovering of armed Ships on our Coasts, so as to endanger or alarm trading Vessels, will acquire importance in proportion as the space entitled to immunity shall be narrowed.\nAnother object not comprehended in the instructions of 1804, to Mr. Monroe, is rendered important by the number of illegal captures and injuries, which have been committed by British Cruisers since that date. An indemnity for them is due on every consideration of justice and friendship, and is enforced by the example heretofore given by Great Britain herself, as well as by other nations which have provided by Treaty for repairing the spoliations practised under colour of their authority. You will press this as an object too reasonable not to be confidently expected by the United States. Many of the claims indeed for indemnification are so obviously just, that a refusal to satisfy them, can not be decently made, and ought not therefore to be presumed.\nThe two modes most readily presenting themselves for a comprehensive provision for the claims, are first the establishment of a Board analogous to that provided for in the 7th. Article of the Treaty of 1794: Secondly the substitution of a gross sum to be distributed among the claimants according to a liquidation to be made under the authority of the United States.\nThe second is the mode most eligible, if the gross sum to be allowed, be thought to approach the amount of losses to be indemnified. To assist you in estimating these the statements addressed to this Department by the Underwriters and others are herewith transmitted. These statements, with those furnished by Mr. Lyman to Novr. 1st. will be to be reducedaccording to the redress which shall have been judicially afforded; and on the other hand to be augmented by the addition of cases not reported here, and to be collected from the sources of information within your own reach.\nIf the first mode should be adopted, great care will be requisite in describing the cases, to employ such general terms as will comprehend all that are fairly entitled to redress. It will be well at the same time to secure, by specifying such of the cases, as can be specified, and as are least susceptible of objection. Under this head may be classed, 1. cases in which the Official communication made by Lord Hawksbury to Mr. King of the 11th. day of April 1801, has been violated. 2. cases in which the rules of blockade stated in Mr. Merry’s communication to the Department of State on the 12th. day of April 1804. have been violated, 3. cases where the Territorial jurisdiction of the United States has been violated. The list of neutral rights asserted in the report of the Secretary of State to the President on the 25th. day of Jany. 1806 will suggest other specifications which may be attempted. It may be worth recollecting that the British order of Council bearing date the 24th. June 1803, and subjecting to capture Vessels on a return Voyage, which had carried contraband in the outward voyage, was never promulged, nor was it known that such a rule was to be enforced until the summer of 1805. Could the rule be regarded otherwise than as it certainly is, an innovation on the law of Nations, all captures before it was made known, and contrary to antecedent practice, would be marked by an unjust surprize, fairly entitling them to redress.\nThe business to come before such a board may be much diminished by the reference of cases, particularly of costs and damages and such others whose description by common consent entitles them to redress, to the Kings Advocate and an advocate to be named on your part (Dr. Laurence for example) who may be authorized to report the sums due, subject to the approbation in each case of Mr. Lyman, our Agent. As far as the cases fall within the observation here made, a liquidation of them may be carried on during the period of negotiation.\nAltho’ the subject of indemnifications for past wrongs is to be pressed as of great magnitude in a satisfactory adjustment of our differences with Great Britain, yet as the British Government may be inflexible in refusing an arrangement implying that her maritime principles of capture were contrary to the law of Nations, whilst she would not be inflexible in stipulating a future practice conformable to our wishes, it is not thought proper that a provision for indemnities should be an absolute condition of the repeal of the Act of Congress concerning British manufactures, provided satisfactory arrangements shall be made relative to impressments, and the trade with enemy’s Colonies. Still however it is to be kept in view, that there are claims founded on acts of British Cruisers violating the law of Nations, as recognized by Great Britain herself, and others founded on unexpecteddepartures, without notice, from rules of practice deliberately settled and formally announced. Of these, examples have been referred to in the communications of Lord Hawksbury to Mr. King, and of Mr. Merry to the Department of State.\nWith respect to claims of these several Kinds, it is evident that provision is clearly due for them, and that it may be made without any implication which can alarm the pride or the caution which may be professed. You will not fail therefore, to bring, if necessary, these claims into view, as distinguished from others founded on controverted principles, and to let it be understood that a refusal of them will be a painful ingredient in the negotiations for extinguishing discontents on both sides, and consolidating and perpetuating the friendship between them. In case this distinction should operate in the adjustment, it will furnish an additional reason for preferring a gross sum, to the liquidations of a joint Board; first, because it will admit of a liberal sum, if the British Government should be liberally disposed, on presumptions not affecting her maritime principles; Secondly, because it will leave the United States free to apply the gross sum, in redressing claims according to our maritime principles. A precedent for such an expedient may be found in the Convention of January 1756, between Great Britain and Prussia; whereby a gross sum of £20.000 Stg. was paid to the latter, as an extinguishment of claims, on account of illegal captures, without reference to the precise rules by which it was to be applied. The Treaty of Pardo in January 1739, between Great Britain and Spain, is another precedent. In that Treaty the sum of £95.000 Stg was stipulated in the like general manner, to be paid to Great Britain by Spain, as a compromise for all reparations of maritime injuries.\nIf the United States succeed in making satisfactory arrangements on the principle points of impressment of Seamen, Colonial Trade, and still more, if provision be also made for indemnity for Spoliations, it may be naturally expected that Great Britain will require, not only the repeal of the prohibition Act of last Session, but also some security that the United States will not, by subsequent Acts of the same nature, place her on a worse footing than other nations. She may reasonably urge that demand on the double plea, of having yielded on these points which were the subjects of complaint on the part of the United States, and of her being now for want of a Commercial Treaty, placed in that respect at the discretion of the United States; whilst they are precluded by their Treaties with the enemies of Great Britain (Holland, France and Spain) from the power of laying prohibitions or restrictions particularly affecting those Nations.\nThe most natural arrangement in that respect will be simply to agree that the two parties shall enjoy in the Ports of each other, in regard to commerce & navigation, the privileges of the most favored Nation. But the Article should be framed so as to embrace, 1st. every privilege and particularly theexemption from higher duties of every description either on imports or exports and including convoy duties, that are paid by the most favored nation; 2dly. All the possessions of Great Britain in every part of the world; which will secure admission, at all times in both the East and West Indies, on the same terms as are now or may in future be enjoyed by the most favored Nation, whether it be a friend or an enemy.\nThe same clause of the footing of the most favored Nation may be extended not only to navigation and Commercial intercourse between the two nations, but to points which relate to the rights and duties of belligerents & neutrals: An arrangement which would secure to Great Britain the same rights in relation to the admission of her armed Vessels in our Ports and to the exclusion of her enemies privateers and of their prizes, which are now enjoyed by Holland, Spain and other most favored nations: Whilst it would place the rights of the United States as neutrals on the same footing with Russia or the most favored Nation, in respect to search, Convoys, blockades and contraband.\nIf it shall be thought eligible to place the reciprocal Commercial privileges of the two nations on a more definite basis, than they would be placed by the general expression of the most favored nation (a stipulation which is liable to the difficulty of ascertaining the equivalent to be given in cases where a privilege is granted by one of the contracting parties to another nation, in exchange for some favor, which the other contracting party cannot specially give) it may be done, either by abolishing all alien duties either on Vessels or Cargo or both, and reciprocally placing the Vessels of the other nation on the same footing with National Vessels conformably to the provision in which Great Britain concurred by an Act of parliament in the year 1802; or by fixing the maximum of alien duty which each nation shall have the right to impose on the Vessels or Cargoes of the other Nation. But should the last plan be adopted, care must be taken 1st. that in fixing the maximum of the alien duty to be levied on Vessels, all charges whatever, and under whatever name known, whether tonnage, light house money, port charges &c. shall be included—2ndly. that the maximum of the alien duty to be levied on merchandize imported in the Vessels of the other Nation (beyond the duties levied on similar articles imported in the National Vessels) shall be a per centage on the value of the merchandize itself and not on the original duty—3dly. that the right of imposing such maximum duties either on the Vessels, or merchandize shall never be exercised so as to contravene the other stipulation of enjoying the privileges of the most favored nation—4thly, that the stipulation shall not embrace Vessels & Cargoes coming from or going to ports from which the Vessels or Cargoes of the United States are excluded.\nShould the expedient of a maximum be adopted it must not be overlooked that the productions of the United States exported to Great Britainemploy a far greater tonnage than the exports from Great Britain to the United States; that the higher the maximum therefore the more favorable to Great Britain, who may avail herself according to the degree of it, to secure to her Vessels the carriage of our bulky productions, of which her duty on Tobacco imported in American Vessels is an example; leaving to the United States the opportunity only of securing to their Vessels, the carriage of her unbulky exports; and that consequently no maximum ought to be admitted more unfavorable to the United States, than the regulations likely to prevail, if uncontrouled by Treaty. A mutual abolition of alien duties would probably be favorable to the navigation of the United States, which would then have to contend on equal terms with British navigation, for which it may be expected to be at least a match at all times, and more than a match when Great Britain is at war, which is not less than half the time.\nThe only great branch of Commercial Intercourse which would remain unprovided for, is that of intercourse with the British Colonies and dependencies: and if nothing can be obtained on that ground, care also must be taken in framing the article for reciprocally enjoying the privileges of the most favored nation, not to deprive the United States of the right of making such regulations as they may think proper in relation to Vessels coming from Ports from which their own Vessels are excluded, or in relation generally to the intercourse with such ports.\nAs the United States confer no particular benefit on the British possessions in the East Indies by their intercourse with that Country, it can hardly be expected that Great Britain will grant any thing more than the general stipulation to be placed on the footing of the most favored nation; or possibly a stipulation to the United States of the privileges heretofore granted to foreigners, which in relation to the coasting trade, and the trade from India Ports to all foreign Countries, as well as that owning the Vessel, exceeded the privileges stipulated in the Treaty of 1794. But as relates to the West Indies and North American Colonies, it must be a permanent object of the policy of the United States, to have the intercourse with them made as free as that with Europe. The relative situation of the United States and of those Colonies, and particularly those wants which we can alone supply, must necessarily produce that effect at some not very distant period. And it should not be voluntarily retarded either by abandoning by Treaty the strong hold which our right of stopping the intercourse gives us, or by accepting any temporary or trifling privilege the exercise of which would diminish the probability of soon obtaining a perfectly free trade.\nIt is not probable that Great Britain will be disposed to open the intercourse to our Vessels with her North American Colonies; nor does it appear that any limitation or restriction can be offered by the United States, calculated to quiet the apprehensions of Great Britain, that to open that trade to our Vessels would destroy their own. It is not perceived that any thingelse can be proposed but perfect reciprocity as is contemplated in relation to the intercourse between the United States and the British Dominions in Europe; such reciprocity to consist either of a total abolition of alien duties or of a fixed maximum as above stated; and the intercourse to be also either general or confined to articles of the growth, produce or manufacture of the United States and of the said Colonies respectively. It must not be forgotten, as relates to our Commerce with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, that however advantageous to both parties, it is more beneficial to the United States than to those Colonies. The importance of not less than 30, perhaps 50 thousand tons of Plaister to our Agriculture needs no comment; and notwithstanding our exclusion from their Ports we have, in fact, as the trade has hitherto been carried on, a greater share of it than themselves. This however is the result of a connivance in practice; which may possibly be withdrawn. The produce of their fisheries is brought by them from Halifax to Boston, and by us from Boston carried to the West Indies. Their Plaister is brought by them from Fundy Bay to Maine, and by us from Maine to New York, Philadelphia and the Chesapeak. A strong jealousy seems to exist between the Shipping interest of Massachusetts and that of these Colonies. Hence the wish of their Legislative Assemblies to prohibit the exportation of Plaister in their own Vessels, to our Eastern Ports; and hence the law which Laid the Light House money tax and a high duty on their fish, taking away at the same time the drawback on the reexportation of such fish. An enlightened policy and a mutual wish to promote the real interest and welfare of the inhabitants on both sides, should induce both Governments to throw the trade perfectly open. But it cannot be denied that it will give us a very great share of their carrying trade.\nThe minimum which should be accepted in relation to the intercourse with the West Indies, will be the admission of our Vessels laden solely with articles of our growth, produce or manufacture, the importation of which in British Vessels is not prohibited, on the same terms as British Vessels solely laden with the Colonial Articles shall be admitted in our ports, that is to say, either without alien duties or with a fixed maximum of such alien duties, with the two following restrictions—1st. that Great Britain may prohibit our Vessels from exporting from the British West India Islands in Sugar and Coffee, more than one half of the proceeds of their inward Cargo—2ndly. That such Sugar and Coffee shall be exported only to the United States, or that the Vessels thus admitted in the West Indies shall be obliged to return and land their Cargoes in the United States, provided they may however, on their return touch at any other West India Island or the Bahamas to complete their Cargo. For it is usual to carry the specie, which proceeds from the sale of a Cargo in the West Indies to Turks Island or the Bahamas and there load with Salt for the United States. Althoughthose restrictions and particularly the first be inconvenient, yet they may be acquiesced in. As respects the first restriction, the value of our average exportations to the British West India Islands, being Six Millions of Dollars, and our importations from thence in every article (sugar and Coffee excepted) being three millions of Dollars, the privilege of bringing in return in Sugar and Coffee one half of the Value of our exportations, will just complete the return Cargoes. But it would be desirable that the restriction should be altogether dispensed with, or that Great Britain should allow the exportation in these two articles to the amount of 2/3 or 3/4 of the value of our Cargoes. As relates to Great Britain, if she once yields the point of admission, the restrictions which are proposed seem to be amply sufficient to remove her minor objections. We now import notwithstanding the nominal prohibitions to some amount in American Vessels, about one million and half Dollars, being the whole amount imported from the British Islands in both American and British Vessels.\nThe value of our average importations from all the world is\nThe value of our annual consumption exclusively of the New Orleans Sugar, is\nTo permit us therefore to import for 3 Millions cannot enable us to reexport. And three Millions of Dollars compared with the value of the Sugar and Coffee exported annually from the British West Indies which amounts to not less than millions, cannot in any degree affect their own Commerce or navigation.\nThe second restriction is intended still more effectually to remove any apprehension that our Vessels might become carriers of British West India produce to any other Country than the United States. And it may even, if insisted on, be further agreed that no drawback shall be allowable on the reexportation of those articles imported from the British West Indies in American Vessels; provided, however, that on that condition the first mentioned restriction limiting the quantity which may be thus imported from the British West Indies in American Vessels; shall be dispensed with. The utmost care is to be taken in framing the restriction on reexporting from the United States, the produce of the British West Indies imported in American Vessels so to express it as to leave no possible pretext for applying the restriction to any similar articles whether produced within the United States, or imported from any other than British possessions.\nIt will be a reasonable Stipulation on the part of Great Britain, that at all times and places at which the trade of the United States is admitted generally or partially, the residence of Consuls and factors shall also be admitted.The duration of the Commercial part of the Treaty, and of any other parts which do not establish in their full extent, the rights of neutral nations, ought not to exceed the term of eight years; and an abridgment even of that term may perhaps be rendered expedient by the tenor of articles not inconsistent with these instructions. I have the honor to be, With great consideration Your most obed. servt.\nJames Madison"

I believe the Spaniards in office here are very uneasy at the expressions in the report of the Comme. of the Reps. lately made public with respect to the acquisition of Florida by purchase or conquest —and that they couple with that the speech about the road to Mexico, on the floor, a year or two since. I am satisfied they are uneasy about the Situation of Cuba, if Florida becomes our property. They are also uneasy about other Boundaries. There are floating hints of our retiring from part of the West side of the Mississippi, and holding Louisiana and part perhaps all of Florida, and having the fifteen Millions reimbursed us. The importance of the Florida ports are said to be highly estimated in Spain andFrance. Tis hinted that France has sold her claim on the US. and does not concern herself about the delivery of the Country by Spain to her & her to us. This may be to induce us to make a treaty of Boundaries, cession and purchase with Spain, which will settle the whole matter satisfactorily.\nThese are loose and imperfect hints, which you will recieve as such, and they are the more freely thrown out because your body of information will enable you to check whatever in them may be erroneous or unfounded. I should not infer that there would be any difficulty as to New Orleans & the River.\nThe Situation of the Spanish Money at la Vera Cruz would induce them to pay largely in that Treasure for an Object they desired, if it were recd. there by us, and brought away at our expence & risk.

If, Sir, a recommendation from the Executives, confirmed by the opinion of the most respectable Citizens of this State, relative to my character, education, deportment, and competency will operate on your mind; I can without difficulty procure the most flattering testimonials.\nNo doubt, many persons whose wealth can maintain them without any compensation from Government will be ambitious of the Station. I confess my fortune is too circumscribed to tender my voluntary services. My reason for not soliciting an active command proceeds from a wish to fill such a situation as would not entirely interrupt the progress of my professional information. I now have the honor of composing part of the Executive of this State. But I consider that every young American ought to contribute his personal exertions, and not remain as idle spectator in the civil department during the approaching conflict.\nI feel an auspicious hope, that the energy of our measures will convince France, that altho’ a few deluded persons, who are indebted to confusion and unsettled times for their consequence, may foster the spirit of faction; still the people of America are resolved to support their happy Government and it’s virtuous administration. When I speak of the people of America, I recognize that class of Citizens, whose talents, virtues and love of temperate liberty are calculated to give importance to social order.\nMay I, Sir, indulge the expextation of hearing from you. If you will rest the fate of my application on the approving language of Maryland; I will immediately resort to the most satisfactory credentials. I have the Honor to be with the highest sense of respect & regard Yr most obt Servt\nJona. R. Wilmer"

My sentiments perfectly coincide with your Excellency’s with respect to this and all other works which have been repair’d or constructed here—I have therefore in every instance been avoiding as much as possible putting the United States to Expense—this occasioned my addressing your Excellency on the Pallisading or friezing the Works at Butts’s hill. The Count is incessantly urging the importance of that post and the necessity of it’s Works being compleated.\nThe enclosed intelligence I have taken this morning from Capt. Earl’s own mouth—He is a man of Strict veracity and full credit may be given to his Account —Many of the french officers are of opinion that the Fleet is bound here—Capt. Earl informs me that Count de Guichen had received information before he Sail’d that Admiral de Ternay was block’d up by Admiral Arbuthnot—that they were under Some apprehensions for the fate of the Fleet but none for the Army, which they Supposed capable of defending itself. The Brittish fleet which CaptainEarl Saw I think beyond a doubt was Admiral Arbuthnot, and furnishes grounds for Several conjectures.

The petitioners accordingly without waiting for documents of any kind embarked on board an Open Boat & rowed to Gull Island a distance of about twelve miles from the mouth of New London harbour and arrived there late at night & accomplished the object of the Expedition.\nHenry Robert Morison, Midshipman, Antonio Malliot & Michael Beckwith Seamen all belonging to the Enemys Ship Superb were captured by the Petitioners & safely delivered to the Deputy Marshall of the district of Connecticut on the 26th Day of August last.\nThe petitioners undertook the Expedition from a wish to render a public service, yet they have undergone much fatigue & some risque in accomplishing the object. It was not a desirable & pleasant matter to row a large Boat from this place to Gull Island & back in less than twenty four hours without refreshment of any kind; nor was it certain that the british had not sent a barge to take off their men in which case the Petitioners would in all probability have been the prisoners. Had there been time for delay the petitioners would have obtained a Commission & would then have been entitled to a Bounty; but the Success of the Enterprize depended entirely upon the promptness of its Execution. The Petitioners so far from being wealthy, are poor men whose ordinary Business is that of fishermen. They conceive that they are virtually entitled to the Bounty of one hundred Dollars per man allowed to private armed vessels for all prisoners brought into the United States. This Bounty the Petitioners & their families need & that the Same may be ordered to be paid them or that they may be allowed some other suitable compensation is the prayer of their petition.

There are loud contestations indeed in one or two of the provinces, and in Britany these have come to blows, and some 3. 4. or 5. people been killed. Still the opposition to the revolution which is working has been miraculously small, and he who would predict it’s failure from the little obstacles which have happened, would be about as good a prophet as he who from the loss of two or three little skirmishes on our part would have foretold our final failure in the American revolution. All the world here is occupied in electioneering, in chusing or being chosen: and, as far as Paris may be considered as offering a specimen of the public mind, we may say it is almost thoroughly ripe for a just decision of the great questionof voting by orders or by persons. The difficulties which now appear threatening to my mind are those which will result from the size of the assembly. 1200. persons, of any rank, and of any nation, assembled together would with difficulty be prevented from tumult, and confusion. But when they are to compose an assembly for which no rules of debate or proceeding have been yet formed, in whom no habits of order have been yet established, and to consist moreover of Frenchmen among whom there are always more speakers than listners, I confess to you I apprehend some danger. However I still hope that the good sense of the body, and the coolness and collectedness of some of their leaders will keep them in the right way, and that this great assembly will end happily.\nThe war in the North will I think continue, and perhaps spread as far as Prussia. The present and probable situation of the Executive in England will, I presume, prevent their engaging otherwise than by giving money. If so, this country will certainly not engage herself the present year, and after the present year, if her states general pass over well, she will be in a condition to do what she pleases. I have lately received a letter from Admiral Paul Jones dated at Petersburgh about the last of January. He was just arrived there on the call of the empress, and uninformed where he was to act the ensuing campaign.We have no news from America later than the 10th. of January, when things were going on well. I find that the friends of the new constitution are generally disposed to make such changes as may be requisite to guard liberty. This will probably reconcile the bulk of the opposition.Nothing could be more agreeable to me than your company on our voiage to Virginia: and I am sorry I am unable to form such an idea of the epoch of it as might enable you to decide whether it suited you. Gouverneur Morris, who is here, informs me that not only there was no Congress when he came away, but that none was expected till the new government. My letters asking leave of absence were not then arrived, and consequently I cannot have that leave but from the new government, nor expect that even they will take it up among their first subjects. This renders the time of my receiving permission incertain, and should it be so late as that I cannot go, do my business there, and return in the fall, I shall prefer postponing my departure hence to the fall, so that I may return in the Spring; being quite decided against a winter passage. You see therefore, my dear Sir, the impossibility of my fixing the epoch of my departure. Pray continue to me duringyour stay your interesting political information and accept assurances of the esteem & respect with which I am Dear Sir Your most obedient humble servt.,\nTh:Jefferson"

The produce which seeks this outlet even from a State as far North as Virginia we learn to be considerable. Persons acquainted with the navigation have assured us that a very small convoy of gunboats would form a sufficient security against the enemy’s barges by which alone the trade is endangered. If it be protected we believe that it will not only benefit the Inhabitants of the Southern States but that it may probably correct that unfavorable ballance which the importation of foreign goods into our Northern towns produces. We beg leave to enclose a letter from two Gentlemen of Charleston of the first reputation for integrity & mercantile knowledge from which it appears that at its date lay in Savannah (for want of convoy) a number of vessels destined for Ameliacontaining of cotton alone an amount which if it were to reach Amelia would perhaps be sufficient to prevent the exportation of nearly half a million of specie.\nIf the flotilla now in the Southern waters cannot prudently be withdrawn from Savannah to be employed as a convoy we would respectfully suggest that the importance of the trade is such as would fully justify the expence of a few gun boats for its peculiar protection.\nGM Troup[and four others]"

But Altho’ I Have Successfully forced myself to Recover the Use of Horse Riding, We Unfortunately are not Within Visiting distance. Let us therefore, now and then, indulge mutual friendship in the only Means of Communication that are Left to us.\nPolitics, as You Justly observe, Have Ever Been our Hobby. oppressed as they are in this European wrong Side of the Atlantic, they are not So desperate as one might mourn them. the11thJuly 1789declaration of Rights, which Has Been then Honour’d With Your Approbation is Still the Creed of An immense majority in france and else where; nor is it possible for Any party or dynasty in this and other Countries to Hope for duration out of the Circle which it Has traced out. Napoleon, an Uncommon man, found means; for Some Years to Escape, Under a Revolutionary Mask and a Heap of Laurels. No Body Now in france Can Stand it So Long: no Court in Europe Could Bet for two Generations of divine Right. the principle of National instead of Special Governments is Working under the Bed of Lies which theSainte allianceare Holding over the European World. france, Vainquished, fettered, and wretched as it is, does still Hold the intellectual and patriotic Lead. italy feels indignant to Be no more a Nation. there is in Spain But a Liberal party;YetSmall as it is, as Well as in portugal, there is to Be found Spirit and Sympathy. You know the Germans. there are Excentricities in their patriotism as Well as in their philosophy. Yet much of it is Boiling in the Northern parts of that Country. England who formerly Shone above all nations, who Still now Enjoys more Liberty and Better Habits than Her Neighbours, is in Her doctrines Behind Some, and Will, in the Course of time Remain More Embarassed With precedents and prejudices than Most of them. old despotism Has But Little to Live in the Civilised World. it Will Be divided Between the British and American doctrines. The Later I Hope Will prevail. in the mean While theSainte alliancewhich is a translation for the WordspilnitzandCoblentzis Endeavouring, Under a Very Shallow Veil of Modernatism to keep Back the progress of political Civilisation, and as I took the Opportunity to proclaim it at the Last American 4hof Julydinner, the Universal Contest is now decidedly Between the doctrine of Rights and the doctrine of privileges.\nthe political feelings of france Cannot But Be Entangled with Several foreign Considerations among Which I include Government itself Since its Restauration Has Been the Work of foreigners, its maintenance Has Hitherto Been intrusted to foreigners, and its ondulations Have forcibly Wavered from the British influence to that of Russia Which Seems now to predominate. But the whole peasantry of the nation, the inferior Classes of the towns,exceptingAfew departments, are Unanimous in their attachment to the Revolution, in their Hatred of foreign influence. The disbanded Army Have mingled With the Mass of the people to the Mutual Benefit of all; the Generations from 20 to 40, if You except the Aristocracy of the Saloons and a few Vanitous people in each town, are all Liberal: the Rising Youth will, I Hope, Be Still Better: So that our political destinies are far from Being desperate. public opinion Has its Weight, its Courtiers, and apower toguard its principal favourites. But the Excesses of the Revolution Have Been So abominable that altho’ the Energies of the people are not inferior to those of 1789, and their Sense of their Rights much more distinct, the existing abuses and designs of privileged tribes find a great auxiliary in the General fear of an other Revolutionary tempest.\nthe New Law of elections, making them, as in England and America, direct, But Confining the Right of Ballot to those who pay three Hundred francs taxes, Has Been Last fall tried for the first time. the prodigious means of influence in Government, the Nomination of presidents By the king, and Several other Circumstances Have Given more indifferent Returns than might Have Been expected. there Has Been in paris a Warm Contest. I Have Had the Honour to Unite Against me, the two parts of the Roïal family, the ministerials and the Ultra Roïalists, the two Sections of foreign,Avowedinfluence. they Have Been all Exerted to a degree which, if it Has Lost myElection, Has Been Upon the whole Beneficial to me. and while Amidst the Entreaties, the Arts, the tricks, the Sacrifices, the threats that Have Been Employ’d (So far as to Say that the foreign powers would think it necessary to keep their Garrisons, and Even to march to paris, my nomination Being Equivalent to the display of the tricolor flag) while Says I You See about three thousand Electors, near one Half of the Richest Citizens, persevere in their determination to Vote for me, You may guess the State of public opinion, the more So as gradually under that mask. You find a progressive Encrease of attachment to the principles and Advantages of the Revolution.\nAltho’ We Have in the Nation an immense majority the odds aregreatlyagainst us in Both Houses. the pure Royalist party Come muchnearer to the party of the ministers, these a Set of men, chiefly of the Bonapartian school who cleverly Enough Have mingled the doctrines of the imperial Cabinet With those of the Royal Ancien Regime. those two Sections Hate Each other, not So much However as they do Hate us. I Have But a Very few political friends Among the peers, Some more in the House of deputés, Enough in Both to put questions, Reveal facts, and publish truths, as the newspapers are inaGreat measure allowed to insert, and the printers Authorized to Sell the opinions of the members whose Reclamations in Both Cases Could not Be Neglected. political pamphlets are also Launched out. Some are Seized; authors are fined or Emprisoned. friends Rise Up in their Support. in Late political trials, mostly the offsprings of the Accusers themselves, our Young Lawyers, our juries Have Behaved Remarkably Well. So are We obliged to Work again to Rebuild what, Had it not Been for the Jacobiners, Bonaparte, the foreign powers, and the nobles and princes of this Land, Would Have Been Honestly and firmly Established five and twenty Years ago. But, this time, it is not only a french, it Has Become an EuropeanBusiness.\nWe are Very Anxious for the fate of Mexico and South America. Your accounts of those Countries which But too well Coincide with Several others, are Very discouraging. But as there is no progress in Civilisation to Be Expected there, unless those Countries are effectually independant, as much at least as the British Colonies Before the War, our Wishes may Safely Be Against Every Attempt from Spain to Subdue the Insurgents. Let us Go farther and Say that if it Has Been the Constant Endeavour of the Governors and Servants of a free Country Like England to obscurateAndshackle the freedom of British America, no Better Will and means Can Be Expected from the Representatives of Spain, Let their power Be Confined to Constitutional Bounds. on the other Hand You See Great Britain intriguing to manage matters So as to Leave to Spanish America as little of freedom, and Get for Herself as much of Commercial Monopoly as She Can obtain it. I don’t know, my dear friend, whether my opinion is a child of those feelings I Had When Commissioners from the Unaknowledged united States Were asking for Support in Europe, But I would not Be Sorry to See the American Government, invested By the follies of Spain, With the Opportunity to take the lead in the affairs of Her independant Colonies. Unless that is the Case or great changes Happen in the European politics the Miseries of those fine Countries Will Be Long protracted. Could you Establish there a Representative System, a free trade, and a free press How many channels of information and improvement should Be oppened at once. I HaveLately Seen aCommissioner from Buenos ayreswho Assures me His Commonwealth is more advanced in political knowledge and practice than we are aware of.\nour friend tracy Has not Recovered His Sight. His Health is tolerably Good. the Commentary on Montesquieu Has Been printed in Belgium and introduced Here in Small Quantities for Sale. some changes Have Been made to present the author as an American, He persisting, Against my opinion, to keep Hisincognito. My Whole family are Well and Beg their Most Affectionate Respects to You.\nI Have Not this Very Long while Heard Any thing of My Louïsiana Concerns. the immense Service You Have Rendered me Has paid off my debts and Cleared a fortune otherwise So overwhelmed that there Were No other means of Salvation for it. Sir John Coghill, one of the purchasers is dead. His Brother and Heir is Expected in france. You know that if I do get the 500 Acres near the town, we Are to divide it By Halves, in Lots of ten acres, and as He intended to LayGooddeal of Money Upon His own Share, my Lots Would Have, without Expense, Acquired a Great Value. a Consideration whichOn Accountof my numerous family Has much Weight. Nor Was I discouraged By the Report that What Remains, after the three HundredtoisesCessionto the town, is of no actual Value, Because it Cannot in time fail to Become Very profitable. But I am affraid those Remains fall Short of the 500 Acres: mrGallatin is of Opinion I ought to abandon the Whole Rather than to Return the price of the Half, as Agreed Between us, to the Heirs of Sir John Should they insist Upon the alternative. I Receive No Letters from New orleans. Should the LocationHavetaken place I ought to Have Heard of it. at all Events, the munificent Grant, Has proved an immense and most Seasonable Relief.\nLafayette"

Nicholas a letter stating that very advantageous offers had been made to his son at Baltimore (late acolonel in the army) which would induce him to go and fix himself at Leghorn, and that it would add very much to his prospects to be appointed Consul there, and counting on my knolege of the character of his son, he supposed my testimony of it to you might befriend his views. With respect to the character of the son I should certainly bear honorable and ample testimony, as of a high order: but there is more than that in the case as it respects myself. I suppose the office to be at present full and that there are considerations due to the incumbent from myself. I cannot give you a better view therefore of the footing on which my answer to the governor places it, than by transcribing what related to it, as follows. “Your favor of yesterday is this moment recieved, and furnishes me matter of real regret; because there is nothing just and honorable which I would not cheerfully do for yourself or any member of your family. But the case in question stands thus. While I lived in Paris I became acquainted with Thomas Appleton of Boston then a young man, and recommended him to the Old Congress as Consul at Leghorn, & he was appointed. On the commencement of the new government he was confirmed by Genl. Washington on my recommendation also. He has been now about 30. years in possession of the office, has conducted himself with integrity and diligence, and has never done an act to incur blame from the government. Under these circumstances it would be immoral in me to sollicit his removal. He is not a man who could be put into comparison with your son on any original competition; but 30. years of possession & approbation cannot fail to be a weight in his scale. I recieved a letter from him some months ago asking my aid to get him removed to Paris from Leghorn. I did nothing in it upon my general principle of declining these sollicitations. I know that Fulwar Skipwith was appointed to Paris, and was preparing to go, when the return of Bonaparte suspended it, some former transactions having made it doubtful whether he would recieve him, and perhaps whether our government could with propriety propose him. How this has been settled I know not. But in the event of Appleton’s removal to Paris, there would be an opening at Leghorn. On the hypothesis therefore that Leghorn may be now vacant I will chearfully communicate your wishes to the President by our next mail. Yet I know at the same time that the President’s own dispositions to do any thing in his power which would be agreeable to yourself or your family will render my application merely an evidence of my wishes to be useful to you.” This extract placing the case fully before you, I will add nothing more to the trouble of reading it but the assurances of my affectionate attachment and respect\nTh: Jefferson"

Under this impression I plainly foresaw that that part of my duty which obliged me to nominate persons to offices, would, in many instances, be the most irksome and unpleasing; for however strong my personal attachment might be to any one—however desirous I might be of giving a proof of my friendship—and whatever might be his expectations, grounded upon the amity which had subsisted between us, I was fully determined to keep myself free from every engagement that could embarrass me in discharging this part of my administration. I have therefore, uniformly declined giving any decisive answer to the numerous applications which have been made to me; being resolved, whenever I am called upon to nominate persons for those offices which may be created, that I will do it with a sole view to the public good—and shall bring forward those who, upon every consideration, and from the best information I can obtain, will in my judgment be most likely to answer that great end.\nThe delicacy with which your letter was written, and your wishes insinuated, did not require me to be thus explicit on this head with you; but the desire which I have that those persons whose good opinion I value shd know the principles on which I mean to act in this business has led me to this full declaration; and I trust, that the truly worthy and respectable characters in this Country will do justice to the motives by which I am actuated in all my public transactions.

The Judges and Town magistrates were elected by the general authority in like proportion.\nSee Montesquieu who prefers this mode.\nThe name of a federal republic may be refused to Lycia which Montesquieu cites as an example in which the importance of the members determined the proportion of their votes in the general Councils. The Gryson League is a juster example. Code de l’Hum.-Confederation\nLyciorum quoqueεὐνομίαν celebrat Strabo: de quâ pauca libet heic subjungere. Fuêre eorum urbes XXIII, distinctae in classes tres pro modo virium. In primâ classe censebantur maximae sex, in alterâ mediae, numbero nobis incerto, in tertiâ reliquae omnes, quarum fortuna minima. Et singulae quidem urbes hae domi res suas curabant, magistratus suos, ordinemque civilem suum habebant: universae tamen in unum coëuntes unam communem rempublicam constituebant, concilioque utebantur uno, velut, senatu majore. In eo de bello, de pace, de foederibus, denique de rerum Lyciacarum summâ deliberabant & statuebant. Coibant vero in concilium hoc ex singulis urbibus missi cum potestate ferendi suffragii:utebanturque eâ in re jure aequissimo. Nam quaelibet urbs primae classis habebat jus suffragiorum trium, secundae duorum, tertiae unius. Eademque proportione tributa quoque conferebant, et munia alia obibant. Quemadmodum enim ratio ipsa dictat, et poscit aequitas, ut plura qui possident, et caeteris ditiores sunt, plura etiam in usus communes, et reipublicae subsidia conferant, sic quoque eadem aequitatis regula postulat, ut in statuendo de re communi iidem illi plus aliis possint: praesertim cum eorundem magis intersit rempublicam esse salvam quàm tenuiorum. Locum concilii hujus non habebant fixum & certum, sed, ex omnibus urbem deligebant, quae videbatur pro tempore commodissima. Concilio coacto primum designabant Lyciarcham principem totius Reipublicae, dein magistratus alios creabant, partes reipublicae administraturos, demum judicia publica constituebant. Atque haec omnia faciebant servatâ proportione eadem, ut nulla omninò urbs praeteriretur munerumve aut honorum horum non fieret particeps. Et hoc jus illibatum mansit Lyciis ad id usque tempus, quo Romani assumpto Asiae imperio magnâ ex parte sui arbitrii id fecerunt. Ubbo Emmius de Republica Lyciorum in Asia.\ninstituted by Amphyction son of Deucalion King of Athens 1522 years Ant: Christ: Code De l’Humanitè\nSeated first at Thermopylae, then at Delphos, afterwards at these places alternately. It met half yearly to wit in the Spring & Fall, besides extraordinary occasions. Id. In the latter meetings, all such of the Greeks as happened to be at Delphos on a religious errand were admitted to deliberate, but not to vote. Encyclopedie.\nThe number and names of the confederated Cities differently reported. The Union seems to have consisted originally of the Delphians and their neighbours only, and by degrees to have comprehended all Greece. 10, 11, 12 are the different numbers of original members mentioned by different Authors. Code de l’Humanitè.\nEach City sent two deputies one to attend particularly to Religious matters—the other to civil and criminal matters affecting individuals—both to decide on matters of a general nature. Id. Sometimes more than two were sent, but they had two votes only. Encyclop.\nThe Amphyctions took an oath mutually to defend and protect the United Cities—to inflict vengeance on those who should sacrilegiouslydespoil the temple of Delphos—to punish the violators of this oath—and never to divert the water courses of any of the Amphyctionic Cities either in peace or in war. Code de l’Hum.\nAeschines orat: vs Ctesiph.\nThe Amphyctionic Council was instituted by way of defence and terror agst. the Barbarians. Dictre. de Trevoux.\nThe Amphyctions had full power to propose and resolve whatever they judged useful to Greece. Encyclop. Pol. Oecono.\n1. They judged in the last resort all differences between the Amphyctionic Cities. Code de l’Hum.\n2. mulcted the aggressors. Id\n3. employed whole force of Greece agst. such as refused to execute its decrees. Id. & Plutarch,Cimon\n4. guarded the immense Riches of the Temple at Delphos, and decided controversies between the inhabitants and those who came to consult the oracle. Encyclop.\n5. superintended the pythian games. Code de l’Hum.\n7. Appointed General of the federal troops with full powers to carry their decrees into execution. Ibid.\n8. declared & carried on war. Code de l’Human.\nStrabo says that the Council of Amphyctions was dissolved in the time of Augustus: but Pausanias, who lived in the time of Antoninus Pius says it remained entire then, and that the number of Amphyctions was thirty. Potter’s Gre. Ant: Vol. 1. p. 90.\nThe institution declined on the admission of Phil and in the time of the Roman Emperors, the functions of the Council were reduced to the administration & police of the Temple. This limited authority expired only with the Pagan Religion. Code de l’Human.\nIt happened but too often that the Deputies of the strongest Cities awed and corrupted those of the weaker, and that Judgment went in favor of the most powerful party. Id. see also Plutarch’s Themistocles.\nGreece was the victim of Philip. If her confederation had been stricter, & been persevered in, she would never have yielded to Macedon, andmight have proved a Barrier to the vast projects of Rome. Code de l’Hum Philip had two votes in the Council. Rawleigh Hist: World. lib 4. c. 1. Sec. 7\nThe Execution of the Amphyctionic powers was very different from the Theory. Id.—It did not restrain the parties from warring agst. each other. Athens & Sparta were members during their conflicts. Quer. whether Thucidides or Xenophon in their Histories ever allude to the Amphyctionic authority which ought to have kept the peace?—See Gillies Hist: Greece—particularly Vol. II. p. 345\nIn 124 olympd. the Patrians & Dymaeans joined first in this league. Polyb. lib. 2. c. 3\nThis League consisted at first of three small Cities. Aratus added Sicyon, and drew in many other Cities of Achaeia & Peloponnesus. Of these he formed a Republic of a peculiar sort. Code de l’Human.\nIt consisted of twelve Cities, and was produced by the necessity of such a defence agst. the Etolians. Encyclo. Pol Oe. & Polyb. lib. 2.\nThe members enjoyed a perfect equality, each of them sending the [same] number of deputies to the Senate. Id.\nThe Senate assembled in the Spring & Fall, and was also convened on extraordinary occasions by two Pretors charged with the administration during the recess, but who could execute nothing witht. the consent of ten Inspectors. Id.\n1. The Senate composed of the deputies made war & peace. D’Albon. I page 270\n2. Appointed a Captain General annually. Co. d’Hum\n3. Transferred the power of deciding to ten Citizens taken from the deputies, the rest retaining a right of Consultation only. Id.\n4. Sent and received Ambassadors. D’Albon. Ibid.\n5. appointed a prime Minister. D’Albon. Ibid.\n6. contracted foreign Alliances. Code de l’Hum.\n7. Confederated Cities in a manner forced to receive the same laws & Customs weights & measures; Id. & Polyb. lib. 2 cap. 3 yet considered as having each their independent police & magistrates. Encyclop. Pol. Oecon.\n8. Penes hoc concilium erat summum rerum arbitrium, ex cujus decreto bella suscipiebantur, & finiebantur, pax conveniebat, foederaferiebantur & solvebantur,leges fiebant ratae aut irritae. Hujus etiam erat Magistratus toti Societati communes eligere, legationes decernere &c. Regebant concilium praetor praecipue, si praesens esset, et Magistratus alii, quos Achaeiδημιουργοὺςnuncupabant. Ubbo. Emmius\nThe defect of subjection in the members to the general authority ruined the whole Body. The Romans seduced the members from the League by representing that it violated their sovereignty. Code de l’Human.\nAfter the death of Alexander, this Union was dissolved by various dissensions raised cheifly thro’ the arts of the Kings of Macedon. Every City was now engaged in a separate interest & no longer acted in concert. Polyb. lib. 2 cap. 3. After in 124 Olympd. they saw their error & began to think of returning to former State. This was the time that Pyrhus invaded Italy. Ibid.\nCommenced in 1308 by the temporary, and in 1315 by the perpetual Union, of Uri, Switz & Underwald, for the defence of their liberties agst. the invasions of the House of Austria. In 1315 the Confederacy included 8 Cantons; and 1513 the number of 13 was compleated by the accession of appenzel. Code de l’Hum.\nThe General Diet representing the United Cantons is composed of two deputies from each. Some of their allies as the Abbè St. Gall &c. are allowed by long usage to attend by their deputies. Id\nAll general Diets are held at such time & place as Zurich which is first in rank & the depositery of the common archives shall name in a circular summons. But the occasion of annual conferences for the administration of their dependent bailages has fixed the same time, to wit the feast of St.John, for the General Diet. And the City of Frawenweld in Turgovia is now the place of Meeting. Formerly it was the City of Baden. Id\nThe Diet is opened by a Complimentary Address of the first Deputy of each Canton by turns, called the Helvetic Salutation. It consists in a congratulatory review of circumstances & events favorable to their common interest—and exhortations to Union and patriotism.\nThe deputies of the first Canton Zurich propose the matters to be discussed. Questions are decided by plurality of voices. In case of division, the Bailiff of Turgovia has the casting one. The Session of the Diet continues about a Month. Id\nAfter the objects of universal concern are despatched, such of the deputies whose Constituents have no share in the dependent bailages, withdraw, and the Diet then becomes a representation of the Cantons to whom these bailages belong, and proceeds to the consideration of the buisness [sic] relating thereto. Id\nExtraordinary Diets for incidental business or giving audience to foreign Ministers may be called at any time by any one of the Cantons, or by any foreign Minister who will defray the expence of meeting. Seldom a year without an extraordinary Diet. Stanyan’s Switzerland\nThere is an annual Diet of 12 Cantons by 1 Deputy from each for the affairs of the Ultramontane bailages. Code de l’Human.\nParticular Cantons also have their diets for their particular affairs, the time & place for whose meeting are settled by their particular Treaties.\nAll public affairs are now treated not in Genl. Diet but in the particular Assemblies of Protestant & Catholic Cantons. D’Albon.\nThe title of Republic and Sovereign State improperly given to this Confederacy, which has no concentered authority the Diets being only a Congress of Delegates from some or all of the Cantons, and having no fixt objects that are national.Dictionaire de Suisse\nThe 13 Cantons do not make one Commonwealth like the United Provinces, but are so many independent Commonwealths in strict alliance. There is not so much as any common instrument by which they are all reciprocally bound together; The 3 Primitive Cantons alone being each directly allied to the other twelve. The others in many instances are connected *indirectlyonly, as allies of Allies. In this mode any one Canton may draw in all the others to make a common cause in its defence. Stanyan By the Convention of Stantz, any member attacked has a *directclaim on the succour of the whole Confederacy. Coxe p: 343\nThe Confederacy has no common Treasury—no common troops—no common Coin—no common Judicatory nor any other common mark of Sovereignty. Id.\nThe General Diet cannot terminate any interesting affair without special instructions, & powers, & the deputies accordingly take most matters proposed ad referendum. Code de l’Hum.\nThe Cantons individually exercise the right of sending & receiving ambassadors—making Treaties—coining money—proscribing the money of one another—prohibing the importation and exportation of merchandize—furnishing troops to foreign States, and doing every thing else which does not wound the liberty of any other Canton. Excepting a few cases spe[c]ified in the Alliances and which directly concern the Object of the league, no Canton is subject to the Resolutions of the plurality. Id.\nThe only establishment truly national is that of a federal army, as regulated in 1668, and which is no more than an eventual plan of defence adopted among so many allied States. Id\n1. The League consists in a perpetual defensive engagement agst. external attacks, and internal troubles. It may be regarded as an Axiom in the Public Law of the Confederacy, that the federal engagements are precedent to all other political engagements of the Cantons. Id\n2. Another axiom is that there are no particular or common possessions of the Cantons, for the defence of which the others are not bound as Guarantees or auxiliaries of Guarantees. Id\n3. All disputes are to be submitted to Neutral Cantons who may employ force if necessary in execution of their decrees. Id. Each party to choose 2 Judges who may in case of disagreement chuse umpire, and these under oath of impartiality to pronounce definitive sentence, which all Cantons to enforce. D’Albon, & Stan.\n4. No Canton ought to form new alliances without the consent of the others. [This was stipulated in consequence of an improper alliance in 1442 by Zurich with the House of Austria.] Id.\n5. It is an essential Object of the League to preserve interior tranquility by the reciprocal protection of the form of Governmt. established in each Canton, so that each is armed with the force of the whole Corps for the suppression of rebellions & Revolts, and the History of Switzerland affords frequent instances of mutual succors for these purposes. Dictre: de Suisse.\n6. The Cantons are bound not to give shelter to fugitives from Justice, in consequence of which each Canton can at this day banish malefactors from all the territories of the League. Id.\n7. Tho’ each Canton may prohibit the exportation & importation ofMerchandize, it must allow it to pass thro’ from one neighboring Canton to another without any augmentation of the tolls. Code de l’Hum.\n8 In claiming succours agst. foreign powers, the 8 Elder Cantons have a more extensive right than the 5 Junior ones. The former may demand them of one another without explaining the motives of the quarrel. The latter cannot intermeddle but as mediators or auxiliaries; nor can they commence hostilities without the sanction of the Confederates: and if cited by their adversaries cannot refuse to accept the other Cantons for Arbiters or Judges. Dictre. de Suisse.\n9. In general each Canton is to pay its own forces without compensation from the whole or the succoured party. But in case a seige is to be formed for the benefit of a particular Canton, this is to defray the expence of it, and if for the common benefit, each is to pay its just proportion. D Albon.On no pretext is a Canton to be forced to march its troops out of the limits of Switzerland. Stanyan\n10. Foreign Ministers from different Nations reside in different Cantons. Such of them as have letters of Credence for the whole Confederacy address them to Zurich the chief Canton. The Ambassador of France who has most to do with the Confederacy is complimented at his Quarters by deputies from the whole body.\n1. disparity in size of Cantons\n2. different principles of Governmt. in difft. Cantons\n3. intolerance in Religion\n4. weakness of the Union. The Common bailages wch. served as a Cement, sometimes become occasions of quarrels. Dictre. de Suisse.\nIn a treaty in 1683, with Victor Amadaeus of Savoy, it is stipulated, that he shall interpose as Mediator in disputes between the Cantons, and if necessary use force agst. the party refusing to submit to the sentence. Dictre. de Suisse—a striking proof of the want of authority in the whole over its parts.\nestablished in 1679 by the Treaty called the Union of Utrecht. Code de l’Humanitè\nThe provinces came into this Union slowly. Guelderland the smallest of them made many difficulties. Even some of the Cities & towns pretended to annex conditions to their acceding. Id.\nWhen the Union was originally established a Committee composed ofdeputies from each province was appointed to regulate affairs, and to convoke the provinces according to art: XIX of the Treaty. Out of this Committee grew the States General Id.—who strictly speaking are only the Representatives of the States General Who amount to 800 members. Temple p. 112.\nThe number of Deputies to the States General from each province not limitted, but have only a Single voice. They amount commonly all together to 40 or 50. They hold their seats, some for life—some for 6, 3 & 1 years, & those of Groninguen & Overijssel during pleasure. They are paid, but very moderately, by their respective Constituents, and are amenable to their Tribunals only. Code de l’Hum. No military man is deputable to the States Genl. Id.

The grand Pensioner of Holland as ordinary deputy from Holland, attends always in the States Genl. & makes the propositions of that Province to States Gl. Id.\nThey sit constantly at the Hague since 1593, and every day in the week except Saturday & sunday. The States of Holland in granting this residence, reserve by way of protestation, the rights, the honors & prerogatives belonging to them as Sovereigns of the Province; yielding the States Genl. only a rank in certain public ceremonies. Id.\nThe eldest deputy from each province presides for a week by turns. The president receives letters &c. from the Ministers of the Republic at foreign Courts, and of foreign Ministers residing at the Hague, as well as of all petitions presented to the Assembly; all which he causes to be read by the Secretary. Id.\nThe Secretary besides correcting & recording the Resolutions prepares & despatches instructions to Ministers abroad—& letters to foreign powers. He assists also at conferences held with foreign Ministers &there gives his voice. He has a deputy when there is not a second Secretary. The Agent of the States Genl. is charged with the Archives and is also employed on occasions of receiving foreign Ministers or sending Messages to them. Id.\nThe avowed objects of the Treaty of Union. 1. to fortify the Union—2 to repel the Common enemy. Id\nThe Union is to be perpetual in the same manner as if the Confederates formed one province only, without prejudice however to the privileges & rights of each province & City. Id\nDifferences between provinces & between Cities are to be settled by the ordinary Judges—by arbitration—by amicable agreement, without theinterference of other provinces otherwise than by way of accomodation. The Stadtholder is to decide such differences in the last resort. Id.\nNo change to be made in the articles of Union, without unanimous consent of the parties & every thing done contrary to them to be null & void.

The Stadtholder has a general & secret influence on the great machine which can not be defined. Id.\nHis Revenue from appointmts. amount to 300,000 florins, to which is to be added his extensive patrimonies. Id.\nThe standing army of the Republic 40,000 men.\nThe Union of Utrecht imports an authority in the States Genl. seemingly sufficient to secure harmony; but the Jealousy in each province of its Sovereignty renders the practice very different from the Theory. Code de l’Hum\nIt is clear that the delay occasioned by recurring to seven independent provinces including about 52 voting Cities &c. is a vice in the Belgic Republic which exposes it to the most fatal inconveniences. Accordingly the fathers of their Country have endeavored to remedy it in the extraordinary Assemblies of the States Genl. in [1584] 1651, 1716, 1717,but unhappily without effect. This vice is notwithstanding deplorable. Id.—Among other evils it gives foreign ministers the means of arresting the most important deliberations by gaining a single province or City. This was done by France in 1726, when the Treaty of Hanover was delayed a whole year. In 1688. the States concluded a Treaty of themselves but at the risk of their heads. Id. It is the practice also in matters of contribution or subsidy to pass over this article of the Union, for where delay wd. be dangerous the consenting provinces furnish their quotas without waiting for the others, but by such means the Union is weakened and if often repeated must be dissolved. Id.\nForeign Ministers elude matters taken ad referendum by tampering with the provinces & Cities. Temple p. 116\nTreaty of Union obliges each province to levy certain contributions. But this article never could & probably never will be executed because the inland provinces who have little commerce cannot pay an equal Quota. Burrish. Bat: illustrat:\nDeputations from agreeing to disagreeing provinces frequent. Temple.\nIt is certain that so many independent Corps & interests could not be kept together without such a center of Union as the Stadtholdership, as has been allowed & repeated in so many solemn Acts. Code d’Hum\nIn the intermission of the Stadtholdership Holland by her Riches & Authority which drew the others into a sort of dependence, supplied the place. Temple.\nWith such a Governmt. the Union never cd. have subsisted, if in effect the provinces had not within themselves a spring capable of quicken[in]g their tardiness, and impelling them to the same way of thinking. This Spring is the Stadtholder. His prerogatives are immense. 1 &c. &c.—A strange effect of human contradictions. Men too jealous to confide their liberty to their representatives who are their equals, abandoned it to a Prince who might the more easily abuse it as the affairs of the Republic were important & had not them fixed themselves. Mably. Etude d’Hist. 205/6.\nGrotius has sd. that the hatred of his Countrymen agst. the H. of Austria kept them from being destroyed by the vices of their Constitution. Ibid.\nThe difficulty of procuring unanimity has produced a breach of fundamentals in several instances—Treaty of Westphalia was concluded without consent of Zealand &c. D’Albon & Temple—These tend to alter the constitution. D’Albon.\nIt appears by several articles of the Union that the Confederates hadformed the design of establishing a Genl. tax [Impôt] to be administered by the States Genl. But this design so proper for bracing this happy Union has not been executed. Code de l’Hum.\ntook its present form in the year, Code de l’Hum\nTheDietis to be convoked by the Emperor, or on his failure, by the Archbishop of Mentz with consent of Electors once in ten years at least from the last adjournment, and six months before the time of meeting. Ratisbon is the seat of the Diet since 1663.\nThe members amount to 285, and compose three Colleges, to wit, that of the Electors—of Princes—of Imperial Cities. The voices amount to 159, of which 153 are individual, & 6 collective. The latter are particular to the College of princes and are formed out of 39 prelates &c, and 93 Counts &c. The individual voices are common to the three Colleges, and are given by 9 Electors—94 princes, 33 of the ecclesiastical & 61 of the Secular Bench.—& 50 Imperial Cities. 13 of the Rhenish, & 37 of Suabian Bench.—The K. of Prussia has nine voices in as many differt. capacities. Id\nThe three Colleges assemble in the same House but in different apartments. Id\nThe Emperor as head of the Germanic body is presidt. of the Diet. He & others are represented by proxies at present. Id\nThe deliberations are groundd. on propositions from Emperor & commence in the College of Electors, from whence they pass to that of the Princes, & thence to that of the Imperial Cities. They are not resolutions till they have been passed in each. When the Electors & Princes cannot agree, they confer; but do not confer with the Imperial Cities. Plurality of voices decide in each College, except in matters of Religion & a few reserved cases, in which according to the Treaty of Westphalia, and the Imperial Capitulations the Empire is divided into the Catholic & Evangelic Corps. Id.\nAfter the Resolutions have passed the three Colleges, they are presented to the Representative of the Emperor, without whose ratification they are null. Id They are called placita after passing the three colleges—conclusa after ratification by Emperor. Id.\nThe Collection of Acts of one Diet is called the Recess which cannot be made up & have the force of law, till the Close of the Diet. The subsisting diet has not been closed for more than a hundred years. Of course it hasfurnished no effective Resolution though a great number of Interesting ones have passed. This delay proceeds from the Imperial Court who refuse to grant a Recess, notwithstanding the frequent & pressing applications made for one. Id\nThe powers as well as the organization of the Diet have varied at different times. Antiently it elected as a Corps, the Emperors, and judged of their Conduct. The Golden Bull gives this right to the Electors alone. Antiently it regulated tolls. At present the Electors alone do this. Id\nThe Treaty of Westphalia & the Capitulations of the Emperors from Charles V downwards, define the present powers of the Diet. These concern—1. Legislation of the Empire—2. war & peace & alliances—3. raising troops—4. Contributions—5 construction of fortresses—6 Money—7. Ban of the Empire 8 admission of New Princes—9. the supreme tribunals 10. disposition of Grand feifs & grand Charges—In all these points the Emperor & Diet must Concur. Id\nThe Ban of the Empire is a sort of proscription by which the disturbers of the Public peace are punished. The offenders life & goods are at the Mercy of every one. Formerly the Emperors themselves pronounced the ban agst. those who offended them. It has been since regulated that no one shall be exposed to the Ban without the examination & consent of the Diet. Encyclop.\nBy the Ban the party is outlawed—degraded from all his federal rights—his subjects absolved from their allegiance—and his possessions forfeited. Code de l’Hum.\nThe Ban is incurred when the Emperor or one of the Supreme Tribunals address an order to any one, on pain in case of disobedience, of being proscribed ipso facto. Id.\nTheCirclesformerly were in number 6 only. There are now ten. They were instituted for the more effectual preservation of the Public peace, and the execution of decrees of Diet & supreme Tribunals against contumacious members, for which purposes they have their particular diets, with the Cheif prince of the Circle at their head, have particular officers for commanding the forces of the Circle, levy contributions, see that Justice is duly administred—that the Coin is not debased—that the customs are not unduly raised. Savage vol. 2 p. 35.\nIf a Circle fail to send its due succours, it is to pay damages sufferedtherefrom to its neighbours. If a member of the circle refuse, the Col. of the Circle is to admonish, & if this be insufficient, the delinquent party is to be compelled under a sentence from the Imperial Chamber. Id.\n(2)Aulic Council—[established by Diet in 1512. Encyclop.] composed of members appointed by the Emperor. Code. de l’Hum.\nIts cognizance is restrained to matters above 2000 Crowns, is concurrent with the jurisdiction of the Imperial Chamber in controversies between the States—also in those of subjects of the Empire by way of appeal from subaltern Tribunals of the Empire, and from sovereign Tribunals of princes. Id.—Arms are to be used for carrying its decrees into execution, as was done 1718 by the troops of the Circle of Upper Rhine in a Controversy between Landgrave of Hesse Cassel & Prince of Hesse of Rhinfitz. Id.\n(1)Imperial Chamber, established in 1495. by the Diet as a means of public peace, by deciding controversies between members of the Empire. Code de l’Hum.\nThis is the first Tribunal of the Empire. It has an appellate jurisdiction in all Civil, and fiscal causes or where the public peace may be concerned. It has a concurrent jurisdiction with the Aulic Council; and causes cannot be removed from one to the other. Id.\nThe Judges of this Tribunal are appointed partly by the Emperor—partly by the Electors—partly by Circles, are supported by all the States of the Empire, excepting the Emperor. They are badly paid, though great salaries are annexed to their offices. Id.\nIn every action real or personal—the Diet—Imperial-Chamber and Aulic Council are so many supreme Courts to which none of the States can demur. The jurisprudence, by which they govern themselves, are according to the subject matter—1. the Provincial laws of Germany 2. the Scripture—3 the law of nature—4 law of Nations 5 the Roman law—6 the Canon law—7 the foedal law of the Lombards. Id.\nMembers of diet as such are subject in all public affairs to be judged by Emperor & Diet.—as individuals in private capacity are subject to Aulic Council & Imperial Chamber. Id.\n1. to enter into war & peace with foreign powers 2 to enter into alliances with foreign powers and with one another, Not prejudicial to their engagements to the Empire Code d’Hum—3 to make laws, levy taxes, raisetroops, to determine on life & death. Savage. 4. Coin money. Id. 5. exert territorial Sovereignty within their limits in their own name. Code de l’Hum 6. to grant Pardons. Savage. p. 44. 7. to furnish their quotas of troops, equipped mounted & armed & to provide for sustenance of them, as if they served at home. Cod. d’Hum\n1. from entering into confederacies prejudicial to the Empire\n2. from laying tolls or Customs upon bridges, rivers, or passages to which strangers are subject, without consent of the Emperor in full Diet.\n3. cannot give any other value to Money, nor make any other kind of money that [than] what is allowed by the Empire. Savage Vol. 2. p. 4.\n4. (by edict of 1548 particularly) from taking arms one agst. another, from doing themselves injustice—from affording retreat, much more, assistance to infractors of the Public peace; the ban of the Empire being denounced agst. the transgressors of these prohibitions, besides a fine of 2000 marks of gold & loss of regalities. Cod. d’Hum.\nEmperor.—has the prerogative 1. of exclusively making propositions to the Diet—2 presiding in all Assemblies & Tribunals of the Empire when he chuses—3 of giving suffrage in all affairs treated in the diet—4 of negativing their resolutions—5 of issuing them in his own name—6. of watching over the safety of the Empire—7 of naming Ambassadors to negociate within the Empire as well as at foreign Courts—affairs concerning the Germanic Corps. 8. of re-establishing in good fame, persons, dishonored by Council of war & civil Tribunal Cod. d’Hum.—9 of giving investiture of the principal immediate fiefs of the Empire, wch. is not indeed of much consequence—10. of conferring vacant electorates—11 of preventing subjects from being withdrawn from the jurisdiction of their proper Judge—12 of conferring charges of the Empire—13 of conferring dignities & titles, as of Kings &c.—14 of instituting military orders—15. of granting the dernier resort—16. of judging differences & controversies touching tolls—17. of deciding contests between Catholic & Protestant States touching precedence &c. Id.—18. of founding Universities within the lands of the States, so far as to make the person endowed with Academic honors therein be regarded as such throughout Germany.—19 of granting all sorts of privileges not injurious to the States of the Empire—20 of establishing great fairs. 21 of receiving the droit des Postes generales—22 of striking money, but without augmenting or diminishingits value. 23 of permitting Strangers to enlist soldiers, conformably to Recess of 1654. Id. 24. of receiving & applying Revenues of Empire. Savage, p.\nHe cannot make war or peace, nor laws—nor levy taxes nor alter the denomination of money—nor weights or measures. Savage v. 2. p. 35.\nThe Emperor as such does not properly possess any territory within the Empire, nor derives any Revenue for his support Cod. d’Hum.\n1. The Quotas are complained of & supplied very irregularly & defectively. Cod. d’Hum. Provision is made by decree of diet for enforcing them, but it is a delicate matter to execute it agst. the powerful members. Id.\n2. The establishmt. of the Imperial Chamber has not been found an efficacious remedy agst. Civil wars. It has committed faults.The Resortissanshave not always been docile. Id.\n3. Altho’ the establishmt. of Imperial Chamber &c give a more regular form to the police of the feifs, it is not to be supposed they are capable of giving a certain force to the laws and maintaining the peace of the Empire if the House of Austria had not acquired power eno’ to maintain itself on the imperial Throne, to make itself respected, & to give orders which it might be imprudent to despise, as the laws were theretofore despised.

When this happy declaration will be known, they will see, I dare say, that every thing has been preserved and praise our good government.\nI was very fortunate to sell my tobacco, tho a very heavy loss will arise, but if you can’t obtain reddress on the etat des achapts, and a total suspension of shippments in america, for more thenone year is not effectuated, I don’t know what will become this article in this Port as well as in other Ports.\nAt Cette six Vessels have been dispatched this spring and summer with wines, Brandy, other articles, but specialy with silver money, to buy tobacco in america: this is calculating\nI must acknowlegde that the Manufactory of Cette is very much provided, they have rented very extensive stores which are quitte full. They expect via Bordeaux 2000 hogshd. Maryland, which can’t be contained at Louviers or at Toulouse for pipe, and 2000 more in January. There is the state of that commodity, which is very allarming.\nYour Packet for Milan will be conveyed by the first opportunity.\nYesterday I have received a Couffe of rice from alexandria unshelled, the other will be sent by the first opportunity. Must I send them to you by land or via rouen?\nOur Ladies and Eulalie begs you to accept their Best thanks for your kind remembrance and their respectfull compliments. I and my son ask from you the continuation of your honourable and worthy friendship, being always at your service, in whatever you may command us.\nI have the honour to be very respectfully Sir of your Excellency the most obedient humble & Devoted Servant,\nEstienne Cathalan, Pr."

    "content": "George town [Md.] jun 22. 1791\nsir\nIn framing the plan, here anexed, for the Intended federal City I regreted much being induced by the shortness of time from making any particular drawing of the several buildings—squars—and every other Improvement which the smalness of the scale of the general map together with the hurry with whichI had it drawn could not admit of having so correctly lay down as necessary to give a perfect Idea of the effect of the whole in the Execution.\nMy whole attention was given to the combination of the general distribution of the grand local[e] as to an object of most immediate moment and of Importance to this I yielded Every other consideration & have in consequence to sollicite again you Indulgence in submitting to you my Ideas in an In Compleat drawing only correct as to the situation and distances of objects all of which were determined after a local[e] well ascertained having for more accuracy had several lines run on the Ground cleared of the wood & after wards measured with posts fixed all along, to serve me as certain bases from after the which I might arrange the whole with a Certainty of making Every part fit to the various ground.\nhaving first determined some principal points to which I wished making the rest subordinate I next made the distribution regular with streets at right anglenorth-south&East-westbut after wards I opened other on various directions as avenues to & from every principal places, wishing by this not mearly to contrast with the general regulariety nor to afford a greater variety of pleasant seats and prospect as will be obtained from the advantageous ground over the which these avenues are mostly directed but principally to connect each part of the city with more efficacy by, if I may so Express, making the real distance less from place to place in menaging on them a reciprocity of sight and making them thus seemingly Connected, promot a rapid stellement over the whole so that the most remot may become an adition to the principal while without the help of these divergent communications such setlements if at all attempted would be languid, and lost in the Extant would become detrimental to the main Establishement.\nseveral of these avenues were also necessary to Effect the junction of several out road which I conceived Essential to bring central to the City in rendering these Road shorter as is done with respect to the bladensburg & Eastern branche Road made above a mile shorter besides the advantage of thier leading from the direction given immediatly on the warfs at george town without passing the Hilly ground of that place whose agrandissement it will consequently check while it will accelerate those over rockcreek on the City side the which cannot fall spreading soon all along of these avenu forming of themselves a variety of pleasent ride and being Combined to Ensure a rapid Intercourse with all the part of the City to which they will serve as doses the main vains in the animal body to diffuse life trough smaller vessells in quickening the active motion to the heart.\nas to on what point it is most Expedient first to begone the main Establishment, I belive the question may be easily resolve if not viewing by part but Embracing under one sight the whole Extant from the Eastern branch to george town & from the banck on the potowmack across towards the montagnes. for considering impartially the whole Extant and reflecting it is that of the Intended City then only one position will appear Capable of promoting the rapid agrandissment & setlement of the whole.\na cross the tiber up above were the tide water come lay certainly the elligible spot to lay the Fundation of an Establishement of the nature of the one in view, not because this point being central is the most liekly to diffuse an Equallity of advantages trough the whole territory and in return to derive a benefit proportional to the rise of its valu but because the nature of the local[e] is such as will made Every thing Concur to render a settlement there prosperous—there it will benefit of the natural jalousie which must stimulate Establishements on each of its opposed limits it will become necessarily the point of reunion of both and soon become populous.\na canal being easy to open from the Entrance of the eastern branch and to be lead a cross the first settlements and carried towards the mouth of the tiber were it will again give an issue in to the potowmack and at a distance not to far off for to admit the boats from the grand navigation canal from getting in, will undoubtedly facilitate a Conveyance most advantageous to trading interest. it will insure the storing of markettes which, as lay down on the map, being Erected all long the canal and over pounds proper to shelter any number of boats will leave of mart House from were when the City is grown to its fullest extant the most distant markets will be supplyed at command.\nto these advantages of first necessity to considere to determine the seat of a City is added that of the positions which there offer and the which are the most suceptible of any within the limits of the Intended city of leading to those grand Improvements ofpublique magnitude and as may serve as models for all subsequent undertaking and stand to future ages a monument to national genious and munificence.\nafter much menutial search for an elligible situation, prompted I may say from a fear of being prejudiced in favour of a first opinion I could discover no one so advantageous to Erect the Congressional building as is that on the west end of Jenkins heights which stand as a pedestal waiting for a monument, and I am confident—were all the wood cleared from the ground no situation could stand in competition with this—some might perhaps require less labour to be rendered agreable but after all assistance of arts none Ever would be made so grand and all other would appear but of a secondary nature.\nthat were I determined the seat of the presidial palace, in its difference of nature may be view as Equally advantageous to the object of adding to the sumptuousness of a palace the convenience of a house and the agreableness of a country seat situated on that ridge which attracted your attention at the first inspection of the ground on the west side of the tiber Entrance it will see10or12miles down the potowmack front the town and harbor of allexandria and stand to the view of the whole city and have the most Improved part of it made as addition to those grand Improvements for which the ground in the dependency of the palace is so proper.\nfixed as Expressed on the map, the distance from the congressional House will not be to great as what Even the activity of business may be no mesage to, nor from the president is to be made without a sort of decorum which will doubtless point out the propriety of committees waiting on him in carriage should his palace be Uncontigous to Congress.\nto mak how ever the distance less to other offices, I placed the three grand departments of state Contigous to the presidial palace and on the way leading to the Congressional House the gardens of the one together with the park and other improvement on the dependency are connected with the publique walk and avenu to the Congress House in a manner of most service a whole as grand as it will be agreable and Convenient to the whole City which from the distribution of the local[e] will have an easy access to this place of general report and all long side of which may be placed play house—room of assembly—accademiesand all such sort of places as maybe attractive to the larned and afford divertion to the idle.\nI proposed Continuing the canal much farther up but this being not to be effectual but with the aide of locks, and from a level obtained of the height of the spring of the tiber the greatest facility being to bring those watters over the flat back of Jenkins I have the more readily a preference to avail of this water to supply that part of the city as it wi⟨ll⟩ promot the Execution of a plan which I propose in this map, of leting the tiber return in its proper chanell by a fall which issuing from under the base of the congress building may there form a cascade of forty feet heigh or more than one hundred waide which would produce the most happy effect in rolling down to fill up the canall and discharge it self in the potowmack of which it would then appear as the main spring when seen trough most grand & majestique avenu intersecting with the prospect from the palace at A point which being seen from both I have designated as the proper for to erect A grand Equestrian figure.\nin the present unimproved state of the local[e] it will appear that the height were is marked that monument close intercept this view of the water from the plalace and in fact it is partly the case but it must be observed that having to bound the Entrance of the tiber ⟨illegible⟩ breadth of a canal of200feet which is the utmost breadth that can be preserve to avoid its being drained at low water. it will require much ground to be trown in to feel up, and at least as much as will Enable to levell that point of heigh ground betwen the tiber and n. yo[u]ng House to almost a levell with the tide water and of Course to procure to the palace and all other House from that place to congres a propect of the powtomack the which will acquire new swetness being had over the green of a Field well level and made brilent by shade of few tree Artfully planted I am with respectfull submission your most Humble a. obeident servant\nP.

I inclose one late Resolve to which I beg your Attention; and I intreat that you will believe me, to be with much Respect Sir Your most obedient Friend\nJames Lovell\nHonble. Doctr Franklin"

Willy and Betty send their duty with that of your Afectionate Daughter\nSBache"

The necessity of continuing the few remaining Men in the field has hitherto prevented this Arrangement from taking place. But we understand that there are now remaining at Camp only Lieutenant Robb, and Ensigns Hoffner and Sneider, with twenty or thirty Privates. Should your Excellency think proper to permit these Men with their Officers to join the others now in this City most of whom are recovering their Health, we will order them to be properly arranged, and endeavour to have the Regiment fit for duty as early as possible. All the new Recruits for said Regiment are to serve during the War.\nIn consequence of your Excellency’s representation, we have issued Orders to the Commanding Officers of Militia to collect all the public Arms as expeditiously as possible, and send them to Philadelphia that they may be repaired if necessary, and put into the hands of Men going into immediate Service.\nAs soon as we received your Excellency’s Letter of the 31st Ulto we gave Orders to Captain Courtnay, who commands the remainder of our Artillery Companies, to have as many of the Men as are fit for duty immediately equipt, and to march them to Camp to join your Army. We find they are but about 50 in number, and expect them to march on Monday next. I have the Honor to be with the greatest Respect Your Excellency’s Most Obedient Servant\nDavd Rittenhouse V.

I have the honor to acquaint you, that by a Letter from him of the 16th, which came to hand yesterday, he informed me, that without waiting for further directions, he had ordered them to proceed with all possible expedition, as the late advices from that Quarter seemed to make a further augmentation of the Army requisite. Besides these, I have, contrary to my wishes but from the necessity of the case, ordered Colo. Morgan to march immediately with his Corps as an additional support. I hope they will be of material service, particularly in opposing the Savage part of Genl Burgoyn’s Force, which from every account spreads a General alarm among the Inhabitants and affects the Winds of the militia not a little, who have not been much accustomed to their mode of Warfare.

The documents I send, have the signature of these gentlemen annexed to them, but for your satisfaction only. Mr Peters is, as you will perceive by a vein in his letter, a man of humour. He is a theorist,and admitted one of the best practical farmers inthispart of the State of Pennsylvania.\nBut, as it is not so much what the soil of this Country actually produces, as what it is capable of producing by skilful management that I conceive to be the object of your enquiry, & to know whether this produce would meet a ready Market & good prices. What the nature of the Climate in general, is. The temperature thereof in the different States. The quality & prices of the lands, with the improvements thereon, in various parts of the Union. The prospects which are unfolding in each &ca &ca. I can do no better than refer you to the Oral information of the bearer, who is a person of intelligence; & pretty well acquainted with the States from New Hampshire (inclusive) to Virginia; and one in whom you may, as I do, place entire confidence in all he shall relate of his own knowledge, & believe what is given from information, as it will be handed with caution.\nMr Lear has been making arrangements for forming an extensive commercial establishment at the Federal City on the River Potomac; and now goes to Europe for the purpose of taking measures, there, to carry his plan into effect. I persuade myself that any information you can give him, respecting the Manufactures of Great Britain, will be gratefully received; and as I have a particular friendship for him, I shall consider any civilities shewn him by you, as a mark of your politeness to Sir Your Most Obedient & Very Hble Servt\nGo: Washington"

Harrison —The quantity of Land mentioned therein, as appears by my plats, is I dare say, the exact number of Acres held by Marshall; for more than which he ought not to expect payment—The three small quantities which serve to compose the agregate 480½ are (I presume) those which lye on Muddy hole—the Northside of the Main Road joining Wades & my line—and on the South adjoining Manley & me—This as it is by actual & careful measurement, & intended for my own satisfaction and government, does I am perswaded, contain to the utmost inch all that he holds, and chearfully acquiesce to it as just—But at all events fix the matter with him by a re-survey or any other way to close the bargain; letting him know however, that if it is resurveyed, and the Surveyor makes it less than 480½ I shall pay for no more than is found bythe last Survey (if it should even fall short of 400 a[c]res) and unless you have conditioned to the contrary, I shall expect, as the Survey will be made to gratifie him, that it will be done at his expense & by the Surveyor of the County—or at least a sworn Surveyor. you will see that the Chain is full 33 feet in length.\nWith respect to the small slipes which he engaged to let me have, the matter taken up in a strict sense, may be determined in a moment, by only solving a single question—to wit—did he, or did he not agree to take 40/ an acre for the Land in the event of not getting Alexanders? If he did not do this, the matter is at an end, because there is not in that case room for even the shadow of argument—If he did, where is the hardship of it? or in other words, why is it a greater hardship to receive money (short of ones wishes) for Lands sold, than for any other thing. The money which General Weedon wants to pay you is due for Lands I sold Doctr Mercer & for the very purpose of enabling me to pay for this and other Lands in that Neck as oppertunities might present; what difference then is there in the cases more than in the Sum? and a case still more in point is, that the very money advanced Alexander was in fact for the payment of this land of Marshalls—It is not harder then upon him to suffer a part than for me the whole—Such local disadvantages as these are to be placed to the misfortunes of the times—some men indeed are benefitted by them while others are ruined—I do not it is true come in under the latter class (so far as it extends to ruin) but I believe you know, that by the comparitive worth of money, six or Seven thousand pounds which I had in Bonds upon Interest is now reduced to as many hundreds because I can get no more for a thousand at this day than a hundred would have fetched when I left Virginia—Bonds, Debts, Rents (in Cash) & annuities undergoing no change while the currency is depreciating every day in value & for ought I know may in a little time be totally sunk.\nI do not labour this point because I expect much from it, but simply to shew Mr Marshall the light in wch he should consider the matter if he has a Mind to act upon such principles as ought to actuate every honest Man—and to shew him moreover the falacy & error of his arguments when he endeavours to prove that I have derived benefits from his Land which he has not experienced from Alexanders—The falacy of them—because if I have taken the timber of, it is not there, consequently the land now is of so much less value—The error of them—inasmuch as I am exceedingly mistaken if he has not inclosed & worked part of Alexanders Land—which (now I am upon the subject) is a matter that you ought to enquire into, as I have some recollection of Alexanders telling me, that he had not only put Marshall in possession of the whole, or such part of the land as he wanted, but thatthe Rents which usually came to him ceased; intimating that the bargain between him, me, & Marshall was so far compleated as that he no longer received the Rents or all of them nor was I to expect Interest for the Money lent him—If therefore I am to pay Marshall for his whole land at the price now agreed at by the acre, and to receive no Interest from Alexander I shall be very prettily handled between the two.\nThis circumstance is mentioned for your government; at the same time I leave you at full liberty to close the bargain with Marshall on any terms if you should even be obliged to allow as much for the slipes as other parts of his land and even to come up to 500 Acres for the quantity as I neither wish to disappoint you, or be disappointed myself in our present views—You will do the best you can to have justice done me—their impositions afterwds I must submit to as a tax to dishonourable men.\nAmong those plats which contained the quantity of Marshalls land you will also find one which shews the contents of those tracts I bought of the two Ashfords & Simon Pearson, which with so much of the waste land (taken up by me) as lyes above the tumbling dam shews (after taking of what Mr Triplet is to get) the amount of what you are to have of me, and how far it will fall short of the purchase from Marshall, thereby enabling you to make a proper settlement—If you find more than one plat of these Lands (as I think there is) the last is the truest, & most correct.\nIt is not reasonable that Mr Triplet should remain longer out of the land which he is to get in exchange for his by my Mill race as there is no prospect of my seeing home this Winter; & yet I really am at a loss to find out how it can be done without my being present, as no person knows the true & complex state of that matter as well as I do—Nevertheless if he desires it, I will give you the best directions I can in order that possession may be given him this Winter. The way that I always expected & wished to have it done was, to extend a line from the bridge, at the head of the race by the tumbling dam to the little branch between that & Morris’s field at the road leading thither—thence by a direct line to the County road, as (if my memory serves me) my fence runs; This, if the fence is removed in, as I think it was Six or Seven years ago, will give as many Acres as I shall receive between the race and the line of my new Patent. but if it should not, then to pay for the difference at whatever the land would sell for at the time of ascertaining the several quantities we give & take—even if it should be £50 pr acre. If Mr Triplet will agree to this, the matter, so far as respects the land, and the use of it to both of us may be settled at any time; and a sum may also be deposited in his hands to be adjusted hereafter; which will prevent his suffering any delay orinjustice on acct of the money he is to receive—or if this will not do, from his apprehension that he shall give more land than he will get (in which I think he will be mistaken, if I am not wrong in my ideas respecting the removal of my fence which was done to this very view) I would in order to satisfie him, and bring the matter as far as possible to a close & without further delay let the line from the branch at the Road as beforementioned bear a little more to the right to include a little more land—a Measure of this kind must remove every difficulty & will certainly give content—the legal fees of the County Surveyor in ascertaining this work would amount to the value of both pieces of land; for not knowing, or not depending, the circumstances, or with a view perhaps to increase his fees, he would Survey Harrisons patent (on which Mr Triplet lives)—Pearsons (the Patentee of which I do not now recollect)—my Land, lately taken up as waste—& part perhaps of that I bought of Geo. Ashford—all of which may be avoided by the mode I speak of; and the disadvantage resulting from the want of a final settlement thrown upon me, by giving him more land, and more money, than he will be entitled to upon a fair & impartial measurement of the exchanged tracts—If you and Mr Triplet should agree without any thing further from me, have a stone, or a locust Post fixed at the road for the corner.\nWith respect to your bargain with Lanphire I can say nothing—I wish every contract that I make, or that is made for me should be fulfilled according to the strict & equitable sense of it—and this in the present case you must be a better judge of than I am—if at the time of engaging him the extra allowance of Corn &ca more was expected & promised than has been performed you are certainly under no obligation to comply with your part till he has fulfilled his—if on the other hand he has fulfilled his you are bound to comply altho it may prove hard—But from your state of the case, the true and equitable construction of the bargain seems to me to be that he ought to have the Corn & Wool, but should be obliged to continue his & servants labor at their present Wages till the covered ways & such work as was particularized or had in contemplation at the time is finished. Without this his wages will be monstrous, the end not answered—& what neither of you at the time could possibly have in view—I therefore think that this is the proper footing to place it on, and, tho slow he had better be kept on those terms till you can at least bring his Wages within the bounds of moderation by time if he should not quite compleat the work expected of him. The Corn (which I am told Qr Master Finnie is now giving Six pounds pr Barl for) should be delivered to him by little at a time for if he gets the whole at once you may, I suppose, catch him as you can.\nI come now to mention a matter which more particularly respects yourself. The depreciation of money, & the sudden rise in the price of produce in the course of this year & other things principally to this cause owing renders your present wages especially under short Crops totally inadequate to your trouble & Services—I am therefore willing that you shd receive a certain part of the last Crop, to be disposed of by you for your own benefit—and so in future—this will give you the reward of yr industry without subjecting you to the peculiar hardship resulting from depreciation as it is presumable that the price of produce will rise in proportion to the fall of the other—I do not at this time ascertain what the part shall be, because I wish you to say what you think is just & right—this it is my full wish to give, & more I do not think you would ask, therefore we cannot disagree. Being little acquainted with the produce of my Estate—amount of Crops—&ca is the reason of my wishing to leave the matter to yourself as it is my first wish that you should be satisfied.\nMr Archer has got the letter you inclosed —& I have only to add that I am sincerely & Affectionately Yrs\nGo: Washington"

In the afternoon the Parson was extremely vehement; in an occasional discourse upon the renewal of the year, he complained exceedingly that the language of the people was “the time is not come.” And with all his powers of eloquence, and of reasoning, he exerted to prove that the time is come. He was rather too violent: his zeal was so animated that he almost had the appearance of being vexed and chagrined. But he said he was not aiming at popularity.\nPassed the evening with Dr. Kilham, at Mr. Carter’s, where we had a whole magazine of antiquity. Miss Sally Jenkins was there; I was pleased with her manners: she is of the middling female size, and has a fine form, the features of her face, are regular, and were not the nose, too much inclined to the aquiline, would be very handsome. Twenty two, I should think her age; but perhaps she is two or three years younger. She conversed not much, and indeed, in the State of female education here there are very few young Ladies, who talk, and yet preserve our admiration. For my own part, the most difficult task that could be assigned me, would be, to carry on a conversation with one of our fine Ladies. The topics upon which they are able to be fluent, are so totally different, from any of those with which I have ever been conversant, that I feel the same embarassment, that I should with one, whose Language I should be wholly unacquainted with. This is not meant however to apply to Miss Jenkins, who is I hope of a different cast: perhaps I shall discover upon a better acquaintance, attractions in her, besides those of person, and they will appear the more amiable, as they are the more rare."

I estimated for fifty thousand Bushels of grain: in your Excellency’s State to Genl. Greene it is called five hundred thousand. I should be glad the Executive would revise their Estimation, and perhaps after correcting these Errors, &c. &c.’\nI trust you would have been more choice in your Terms had you revised the estimate yourself as recommended to us. I send you a Copy of it wherein you will find the quantity of Corn or Oats expressed in these Figures and Letters ‘500000 Bushels’. Ona former estimategiven in some Days or perhaps Weeks before this, the quantity required was ‘for 2326 draft Horses and 779 saddle Horses till the 1st of August was 282,490 Bushels’. I did not therefore magnify the Article to General Greene, and your now speaking of 50.000 bushels as the Quantity required shews that I had reason to intimate to the Genl. the necessity of a new Calculation on the true Number of Horses connected with the Southern army and the proportion of this, which on view of actual Circumstances we ought to furnish. I believe the estimate at 50:000 Bushels to be as far wrong as that at 500,000. We shall be governed by neither, but will furnish as much as we shall be able. It will probably be short of the middle Quantity; should you have represented this Article to General Greene to have been magnified by us, I shall expect from your Justice that you will be equally ready to correct as to commit an Error and that you will take the trouble to inform him that I had not been so deficient in respect either to him or myself as to magnify things of which I undertook to give him representation. Major Claiborne had the half million of Pounds which we promised him of the late Emission. When the Treasury is replenished he shall again have a due Proportion to enable him to procure such Part of the Estimate as he thinks proper. I am, &c.,\nT. J."

Three other Regiments left to Guard the Passes upon Hackinsack River and to serve as covering Parties are expected up this Evening. After the unfortunate Loss of Fort Washington it was determined to evacuate Fort Lee in a great Measure, as it was in a Manner useless in obstructing the Passage of the North River without the Assistance of Fort Washington. The Ammunition and some other Stores were accordingly removed but before we could effect our purpose the Enemy landed Yesterday Morning in very considerable Numbers about 6 Miles above the Fort. Their Intent evidently was to form a line across from the place of their landing to Hackinsack Bridge and thereby hem in the whole Garrison between the North and Hackinsack Rivers. However we were lucky enough to gain the Bridge before them, by which Means we saved all our Men, but were obliged to leave some hundred Barrels of Flour, most of our Cannon and a considerable parcel of Tents & Baggage. Finding we were in the same danger of being pent up between Hackinsack & Pasaiac Rivers that we had between the North and Hackinsack, and also finding the Country from its Levelness and Openness unfit for making a Stand, it was determined to draw the whole of our Force over to this Side of the River, where we can watch the Operations of the Enemy without danger of their surrounding us or making a Lodgment in our Rear. But as our Numbers are still very inadequate to that of the Enemy I imagine I shall be obliged to fall down towards Brunswic and form a Junction with the Troops already in that Quarter under the Command of Ld Stirling. As the Term of the Inlistment of the Flying Camp belonging to Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland is near expiring, it will occasion so great a diminution of my Army, that I submit it to your Judgment,whether it would not be proper for you to call together such a Number of Militia, as in Conjunction with the Troops I shall have left, will serve to cover the Country and stop the Progress of the Enemy if they should still attempt to penetrate. If the Weather continues favourable I am apprehensive they will attempt to make amends for the slowness of their Operations the beginning of the Campaign.

    "content": "Hartford February 6th.1790—\nDear Sir\nYour letter found me on my return from the session of our Superior Court at Haddam—since which, I have attended a three weeks session of our County Court here. So that I have had little leisure to prepare for my defence in a capital Trial.\nTo your charge ofreading myself to death, I now propose to plead double by leave of the Court. My first Plea is that I am yet alive. Lord Hale advises Courts to be cautious of condemning any Person for Murther, unless it be clearly proved, that the man, supposed to be murdered is actually dead— I have looked over my Books & cannot find a single precedent of any man, indicted & hanged for Self murder.\nIn the next place, I shall plead not guiltyinfra sex annos— It is hard if there is no act of limitation in the case. From the year 1777 to the year 80, I resided in my native town in a part of the country, where I could have no more Society than a Hermit, & had no other amusement but my Books. I injured my health gradually by continual reading & writing—for I determined to be the most learned Man in America; But hurt my constitution still more by attending all the Courts in two adjacent Counties, thro’ the storms & snows of the severe winter of 80— In the spring of that year I found my nerves relaxed to the utmost degree of debility. I had a shock of an uncommon kind, which I scarcely survived. It came on with a coldness, & loss of pulsation, tho’ not of feeling in all my limbs, which gradually extended itself nearly to the trunk of my body, attended with violent headach & palpitation of the heart— It left me subject to faintness, vertigo, loss of appetite, frequent turns of sick-headach, & every symptom of nervous decay. Before the close of that year my physicians pronounced me in the last stage of a consumption— I discarded them, & undertook to prescribe for myself. I removed to Hartford in 81, by way of experiment, as Yorick went to France, to run away from death. Since that time I have been graduallyregaining health, & tho’ sufficiently an Invalid, am able to transact more business in my profession, than any Lawyer in the County. Nor do I attend more to my studies, than is necessary to preserve the reputation I have gained in my profession, & do justice to the Causes in which I am engaged. Besides the want of health, I have had many disadvantages to combat in attempting to rise to eminence as a Lawyer. No man can be a judge of his own manner of speaking—but my friends have early been careful to inform me, that except a tolerable fluency, with some degree of animation, I possessed no one talent of a public speaker; that my voice was harsh & disagreable, my gestures stiff, my pronunciation naturally thick & inarticulate, & my style void of that sonorous pomp, which captivates the ears of a vulgar audience— That no genius can excell in more ways than one, that I must be content with my literary reputation, & give up all hope of excellence at the Bar. I was not willing to be so content—but what could be done— I had only two resources left—Learning&Fidelityto my Clients—I have tried them & they have availed me. Nor have I any rival in my business in my own County. In the last Superior Court, I argued every cause tried before them, during a fortnight’s session, except one— At our County Court just now closed, I lost only three causes—I argued more than twenty— It is alledged that I have too great influence with the Courts, especially the County Court— But the secret is, that I judge my causes before I try them, & will try none that I think desperate. So much for boasting— I observe the alternative penance you propose me— I own myself too indolent for the five miles walk a day, & had rather submit to the seat in a house of Representatives— But I have little inclination for either— Many of my friends have urged me to attempt promotion in the political line— I have as yet purposely avoided it, & avoided it with great ease—as I have not one popular talent in my whole composition, & would not give up my right of speaking & writing my sentiments on men & measures, and of personally attacking all, whom I have viewed, as enemies to the Public, for any office or honour, I could expect in the States. And I firmly beleive that I have been of more service, in that way, to my country, than I could have been, if courting popularity, I had been able to act in any official character. I have by these means made myself many enemies—but I hug myself in the independence of my situation, & laugh at the storm, that rattles on my roof. I hope however, that the Stability of the new Government, will supersede the necessity of political Satirists.— If the public find they want me in any other way, they will call for me, but I shall neversolicit their votes, which I consider as conferring burthens & not favors.\nThus much & perhaps too much, I have written on myself by way of vindication. I shall now take up a more important subject, and in return for the advice received, (for I do not choose to be in any Man’s debt) address some hints to the Vice-President, relative to his own political situation, & the strictures made upon his conduct by his Enemies. I shall ask no excuse for my assurance, & am certain my motive needs no Apology.\nBe it remembered then, that the Vice-President is a native of New England, & that the inhabitants of the Southern States are not yet entirely cured of their local jealousies—that without any considerable advantages from the pride of family, or the favours of fortune, he has raised himself to that eminent station, solely by his personal merit, & the importance of his public services—& that this circumstance has provoked the pride & raised the envy of many of the Southern Aristocrats, who suppose themselves born to greatness, & cannot bear to be eclipsed by merit only— That this Party are endeavouring to represent his character in an unfavorable light, & if possible prevent his ever rising to the first office in the States, whenever a vacancy shall happen. The obloquy they have endeavoured to raise against him, as having deserted his republican principles, & become fond of the splendor, & titles of monarchical Courts, is well known, & needs no remark, because it has nearly subsided in the New England States, where his character is known & justly appreciated—it may perhaps still be a subject of unjust censure in the southern States— But must there at length subside, as their people, who are an age behind us in political knowlege, become convinced of the necessity of energy in the executive Department. But they attempt an attack on another ground, & endeavour to render him unpopular in the Senate, the principal theatre on which his political talents can now be exerted. They assert that the Constitution gives the President of the Senate no right to mingle in their debates—that he can on no occasion with propriety offer his sentiments at large, except when he is requested to give information respecting the affairs of foreign courts, which have fallen under his personal observation, or when in case of an equivote, he states his reasons on giving his casting voice. They add that as a public Speaker, the talents in which he excells all others, are force of argument & strength of language, approaching to sarcasm, and expressive of some degree of contempt for the opinions & reasonings of his adversaries—that inconsequence, whenever he mingles in debate, he offends those whose sentiments he opposes—while the party he supports are not always pleased, as his idea of the necessity of affording his assistance is a tacit reflection on them, as incompetent advocates of a good cause—that he who mingles in debate subjects himself to frequent retorts from his opposers, places himself on the same ground with his inferiors in rank, appears too much like the leader of a Party, & renders it more difficult for him to support the dignity of the chair, & preserve order & regularity in the debate—while he gives his enemies frequent opportunity by reporting casual expressions, which have fallen in the warmth of argument, to misrepresent his opinions & designs, with little danger of detection—as the doors of the Senate are always shut.\nOf the truth or justice of these remarks I am no judge—but I have heard them so frequently made, & sometimes by men who I am sure are not unfriendly, and in every other respect have the highest esteem for your abilities & character, that I thought it my duty to communicate them—especially as on so delicate a subject it was doubtful whether You would hear of them in any other way— I should have chosen to hint them in a personal interview, but my business has disappointed me of a visit to New York, which I had intended in the course of this winter.\nI congratulate You on the favorable Prospect of the firm establishment of our Government— The proceedings of the last Session are generally approved— The clamours attempted to be raised on the subject of Salaries have died away—and our most sensible men would rather see an augmentation in one or two instances than a considerable diminution in any.\nVesting in the President the power of removing all officers in the executive department is a most important amendment of the Constitution in the only part in which I ever thought an amendment essential, or a defect absolutely necessary to be supplied. The other proposed amendments are very harmless at least— The Article, which establishes the right of Trial by jury in all cases at common law, I should object against, as holding out a false light, because in many cases, it must be absurd, if not impossible to carry it into execution—but the very objection shows that it is not dangerous.\nThe establishment of Fœderal Courts entirely separate from those of the States was another measure of equal importance, the effect will not be immediately seen, but will be eventually of the highest consequence. In a word, though there are sundry members ofCongress, whose opinions on Government have never advanced beyond the crude ideas of pure Democracy which we imbibed at the beginning of the Revolution, the Majority appear sufficiently enlightened to carry every necessary measure, for establishing an energetic Government, armed with power for our Protection & Defence\nExcuse the length of this Letter, which has far exceeded my intention— Please to present my most respectful Compliments to Mrs.Adams—and believe me to be with the highest respect & most sincere Attachment—Dear Sir / Your obliged & most Obedt./ Humble Servant\nJohn Trumbull"

I asked the favor of your Excellency as I did of the Governors of other states not furnishing in their interior country flour sufficient for the consumption of the state, to take the trouble of giving certificates, in favor of any merchants meriting confidence, for the quantities necessary for consumption beyond the interior supplies. having desired from the Treasury department a statement of the quantities called for under these certificates, I find that those of your Excellency recieved at the Treasury amount to 51,000. barrels of flour, 108,400 bushels of Indian corn, 560. tierces of rice, 2000. bushels of rye, and in addition thereto that there had been given certificates for either 12,450 barrels of flour or 40,000 bushels of corn. as these supplies, altho called for within the space of two months; will undoubtedly furnish the consumption of your state for a much longer time, I have thought it advisable to ask the favour of Your Excellency, after the reciept of this letter, to discontinue issuing any other certificates, that we may not unnecessarily administer facilities to the evasion of the embargo laws. for I repeat, what I observed in my former letter, that these evasions are effected chiefly by vessels clearing coastwise. but while I am desirous of preventing the frauds which go to defeat the salutary objects of these laws, I am equally so that the fair consumption of our citizens may in no wise be abridged. it would therefore be deemed a great favor if Your Excellency could have me furnished with an estimate, on the best data possessed, of the quantities of flour, corn & rice which, in addition to your internal supplies, may be necessary for the consumption, in any given time, of those parts of your state which habitually depend on importation for these articles. I ask this the more freely because I presume you must have had such an estimate formed for the government of your discretion in issuing the preceeding certificates, and because it may be so necessary for our future government.

It might be a political Subject, and relate, to the Times, but I know not whether it really was. His Text in the Afternoon, was from Hebrews XII. 1. Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with a great Cloud of Witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the Sin, which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with Patience the Race that is set before us. I seldom hear much of Mr. H’s Sermons, except the Texts. Dined at Mrs. Dana’s. She laugh’d at a certain Class mate of mine, who all at once, wears green silk before his Eyes, as if they were injured by hard Study. But certainly every one, who knows him, will exculpate Study from that fault.\nAfter Prayers I went with Mead, and pass’d the evening at Professor Pearson’s. Mr. and Mrs. Rogers were there. The Professor, is a much more agreeable, and indeed a more polite Man, than I should have suspected, from what I have heard. I have not seen any Person belonging to the Government, so polite to Scholars, or show so few Airs. Mrs. Pearson is likewise very agreeable."

As a citizen and longtime resident of New York soon to return to his native Germany, he offers himself as a consul with the intention of aiding German families there and in America because “some known Organ of communication between the two Countries” is needed on account of the extensive emigration from the Rhine region to the United States. Such an appointment would serve to assist people in remitting property to those presently settled in America and to foster future emigration, but he also wishes to promote the trade already underway between the United States and several cities on the Rhine. He hopes the letter from “Messr. Murray, Sands, Bache, W. Laight and Verplank” will aid his claim, and Senator Rufus King assures him that he will promote the application. Through TJ he asks the President to appoint him consul at Nürnberg in Franconia, Frankfurt am Main, or the Palatine Electorate including the bishopric of Franconia, the countries from which most of the immigrants have come, but an appointment comprehending all these jurisdictions would enable him to be more useful."

The character given of a certain great Personage, who is remarkable for neither forgetting or forgiving, I believe to be just. What effect the addition of such an extraordinary weight of power & influence as the arrangement of the East India affairs gives to one branch of the British governmt cannot be certainly foretold: but one thing is certain, that is to say, it will always be wise for America to be prepared for events. Nor can I refrain from indulging the expectation that the time is not very distant, when it shall be more in the power of the United States than it hath hitherto been, to be forearmed as well as forewarned against the evil contingencies of European politics.\nYou will have perceived from the Public papers, that I was not erroneous in my calculation that the Constitution would be accepted by the Convention of this State. The majority, it is true, was small; & the minority respectable in many points of view. But the greater part of the minority here, as in most other States, have conducted themselves with great prudence & political moderation; insomuch that we may anticipate a pretty general and harmonious acquiescence. We shall impatiently wait the result from New York & North Carolina. The other State which has not yet acted is nearly out of the question. As the infamy of the conduct of Rhode Island outgoes all precedent, so the influence of her Counsels can be of no prejudice. There is no State or description of Men but would blush to be involved in a connection with the Paper-money Junto of that Anarchy. God grant that the honest men may acquire an ascendency before irrevocable ruin shall confound the innocent with the guilty.\nI am happy to hear from General Lincoln & others that affairs are taking a good turn in Massachusetts. But the triumph ofsalutary & liberal measures over those of an opposite tendency seems to be as complete in Connecticut as in any State & affords a particular subject for congratulation. Your friend Colo. Humphreys informs me, from the wonderful revolution of sentiment in favor of fœderal measures, and the marvellous change for the better in the elections of your State, that he Shall begin to suspect that miracles have not ceased. Indeed, for myself, since so much liberality has been displayed in the construction & adoption of the proposed general Government, I am almost disposed to be of the same opinion. Or at least we may, with a kind of grateful & pious exultation, trace the finger of Providence through those dark & misterious events, which first induced the States to appoint a general Convention & then led them one after another (by such steps as were best calculated to effect the object) into an adoption of the system recommended by that general Convention—thereby, in all human probability, laying a lasting foundation for tranquility & happiness; when we had but too much reason to fear that confusion and misery were coming rapidly upon us.\nThat the same good Providence may still continue to protect us & prevent us from dashing the cup of National felicity just as it has been lifted to our lips, is the earnest prayer of My dear Sir Your faithful friend & Affectionate Servt\nGo: Washington"

The Act of Feb. 7. 1799. makes it 5 Cents per mile equal at this season to near two dollars a day, and 1¼dols. during attendance on the Court. The Marshall will of course apprize the attending Witnesses of their legal claim, and there is not time now to take any steps as to those who may not have already undertaken the Journey. The President suggests that the Witnesses agst. White ought to be got to Richmond for the trial of Burr.

    "content": "St: Petersburg 14 September 1813\nMy Dear Son.\nThe fourth and last point of view, in which I proposed to offer you some general observations upon the sacred Scriptures, was with reference toLiterature. And the first remark which presents itself here is that the five Books of Moses, are the most antient monument of written language, now extant in the World—The Book of Job is nearly of the same date, and by many of the Christian and Jewish Commentators is believed to have been written by Moses.\nThe employment of alphabetical characters to represent all the articulations of the human voice, is the greatest invention that ever was compassed by human Genius—Plato says that it was the discovery either of a God, or of a man divinely inspired—The Egyptians ascribed it to That, whom the Greeks afterwards worshipped under the name of Hermes—This however is a fabulous origin—That it was an Egyptian invention there is little reason to doubt, and it was a part of that learning of the Egyptians, in all of which we know that Moses was versed.\nIt is probable that when Moses wrote, this Art was if not absolutely of recent, yet of no very remote invention—There was but one copy of the Law written in a Book; it was deposited in the Ark of the Covenant; and was read aloud once in seven years, to all the People at their general Assembly in the feast of tabernacles. Deut: XXXI. 9. 10.—25.26.—There was one other copy, written upon stones, erected on mount Ebal. Deut. XXVII. 3–8.—It does not appear that there existed any other copies—In process of time, the usage of reading it every seven years must have been dropp’d, and the monument upon mount Ebal must have perished—For in the reign of Josiah (II. Kings. XXII.) about eight hundred years afterwards, the Book of the Law wasfoundin the Temple—How long it had been lost is not expressly told; but from the astonishment and consternation of Josiah upon hearing the book read, its contents must have been long forgotten, so that scarcely a tradition of them remained—We are indeed told I Kings VIII.9. and II Chron: V. 10. that when the Ark of the Covenant was deposited in the Temple of Solomon, “there wasNothingin the ark, save the two tables, which Moses put therein at Horeb.” The two tables contained, not the whole Law, but only the ten Commandments (Deut. V. 22.—X. 4. 5.) The Book of the Law, was therefore no longer in the Ark, at the Dedication of Solomon’s Temple; that is about 500 years the Law was given, and 300 years before the Book was found by Hilkiah the High-Priest in the 18th: year of Josiah.\nFrom these Circumstances, as well as from the expedients used by Moses and Joshua, for preserving the memorial of the Law, and the repeatedCovenants, between God and the People (Deut: V.2. X.I. XXIX.I Joshua XXIV.25.) it is obvious that the art and the practice of writing were extremely rare—that very few of the People were ever taught to read; that there were few books extant, and of those few only single copies.\nThe Arts of writing, speaking and thinking, with their several modifications of Grammar, Rhetoric, and Logic, were never cultivated among the Hebrews, as they were, though not untill nearly a thousand years later than Moses, among the Greeks—Philosophical research, and the Spirit of Analysis, appears to have belonged among the Antient Nations exclusively to the Greeks—They studied language as a Science, and from the discoveries they made in this pursuit, resulted a system of literary composition founded upon logical deductions—The language of the sacred writers was not constructed upon the foundation of abstruse Science—It partakes of the nature of all primitive language, which is almost entirely figurative; and in some degree of the character of primitive writing and of hieroglyphics—We are not told from what materials Moses compiled the Book of Genesis, which contains the History of the Creation, and of three thousand years succeeding it, and which terminates three Generations prior to the birth of Moses himself.—Whether he had it altogether from tradition, or whether he collected it from more antient written orpaintedmemorials. The Account of Creation, of the Fall, and all the antedeluvian part of the History carries strong internal evidence of having been copied or if I may so express myself, translated from hieroglyphical or symbolical records—The narrative is of the most perfect simplicity—the discourses of the persons introduced are given as if taken down verbatim from their mouths, and the narrative is scarcely any thing more than the connecting link of the discourses—The Genealogies are given with great precision, and this is one of the most remarkable peculiarities of the Old Testament—The rest is all figurative—The Rib, the Garden, the Trees of life, and of the knowledge of Good and Evil, the Apple, the Serpent, are all images, which seem to indicate a hieroglyphical origin\nAll the historical Books both of the Old and new Testament retain the peculiar characteristics that I have noticed—the simplicity and brevity of the Narrative—the practice of repeating all discourse, as in the identical words spoken, and the constant use of figurative, symbolical and allegorical language—But of the Rules of composition prescribed by the Grecian Schools, the unities of Aristotle, or the congruities of figures taught by the Greek philologists, not a feature is to be seen—The Psalms are a collection of Songs—The song of Solomon is a Pastoral Poem; the Proverbs are a collection of moral sentences and maxims, apparently addressed by Solomon to his Son, with the addition of some others of the same description—The prophetical Books are partly historical, and partly poetical—They contain the narrative of the Visions, and other Revelations of the Deity to the Prophets who recorded them—In the New Testament, the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles are historical—They contain memoirs of the life of Christ, and some of his discourses; and the proceedings of his principal Apostles for some years immediately after his decease—The simplicity of the narrative is the same as that of the Old Testament; the style in general indicates an age when reading and writing had become more common, and books more multiplied—The Epistles of St: Paul are the productions of a mind educated to the learning of the age, and well versed even in the Grecian Literature—From his History it appears that he was not only capable of maintaining an Argument with the Doctors of the Jewish Law, but of discussing Principles with the Stoic and Epicurean Philosophers—His Speech at Athens, as a specimen of Eloquence was worthy of an Audience in the native Country of Demosthenes—The Apocalypse of St: John, resembles in many Respects some of the prophetical Books of the Old Testament—The figurative, symbolical and Allegorical Language of these Books, shew a range of Imagination, suitable only to be the record of Dreams and Visions—their meaning is in many parts inexplicably obscure—It has been and is to this day among the follies and vices, of many Sects of Christians to attempt explanations of them adapted to Sectarian purposes and opinions. The style of none of the Books either of the old or new Testament, affords a general model for imitation to a writer of the present age—The principles and rules of composition derived from the Greek and Roman Schools, and the examples of their principal writers, have been so generally adopted in modern literature, that the style of the Scriptures, differing so essentially from them could not be imitated without great affectation—But for pathos of narrative—for the selection of incidents that go directly to the heart—for the picturesque of character and manners; the selection of circumstances that mark the individuality of persons; for copiousness, grandeur and sublimity of imagery, for unanswerable cogency and closeness of reasoning and for irresistible force of persuasion, no Book in the world deserves to be so unceasingly studied, and so profoundly meditated upon as the Bible.\nI shall conclude here the series of letters, which I purposed about two years since to write you, for the purpose of exhorting you to Search the Scriptures, and of pointing out to your Consideration the general points of application with a view to which, I thought this Study might be made profitable to the improvement and usefulness of your future life—There are other and particular points, to which I may hereafter occasionally invite your attention—I am sensible how feeble and superficial, what I have written has been; and every letter has convinced me more and more of my incompetency to the adequate performance of the task I had assumed—But my great object was to shew you the importance of devoting your own faculties to this pursuit. To read the Bible is of itself a laudable occupation, and can scarcely fail of being an useful employment of Time—But the habit of reflecting upon what you have read is equally essential as that of reading itself to give it all the efficacy of which it is susceptible—I therefore now recommend it to you to set apart a small portion of every day to read one or more Chapters of the Bible, and always to read it with reference to some particular train of observation or of reflection—In these letters I have suggested to you four general ones—considering the Scriptures as Divine Revelations—as Historical Records—as a System of Morals—and as literary Compositions—but there are many others points of view in which they may be subjects of useful investigation—As an expedient for fixing your own attention, make it also a practice for some time to minute down in writing your reflections upon what you read from day to day—You may perhaps at first find this irksome, and your reflections themselves scanty and unimportant—but they will soon become both easy and copious. And be careful above all, not to let your reading make you either a pedant or a bigot—let it never puff you up with a conceited opinion of your own knowledge, or make you intolerant of the opinions which others drew from the same source; however different from your own—And may the merciful Creator who gave the Scriptures for our Instruction, bless your study of them, and make them to you fruitful of good works!—\nfrom your affectionate father.\nA."

I found myself with a slight inflamation on one eye & some flying Rheumatic pains, to which not suspecting any thing serious I paid little attention. By the 25th. my Eyes were so much inflamed that it was with difficulty I read your letter which I received that morning. Throughout the course of the day those symptoms attended with a little fever increased & convinced me that I was not to be well in a few days. Under these circumstances it appeared to me best if possible to return home. I set out the next day, the weather was favorable, & I arrived with much pain the day before yesterday. Not withstandingbleeding & physick, both inflamation & Rheumatism continue obstinate. As my eyes would not permit me to answer your letter I’ve sent it to Mr. King. Judge Cushing does not appear yet. It wd. be a sad thing if he also shd. be laid up. Respecting the duration of my confinement I can as yet form no conjectures.

I shall be happy if they are accepted.\nI owe you an answerto a letter long since recieved and which constant emploiment has prevented my answering. it was on the subject of Colo. Mc.lane. you will recollect that when Govr.Hall& yourself were here, I mentioned that he stood on the ground of all others, liable to be removed if he should be active in opposition to the present order of things: and you both expressed entire satisfaction that it should rest on that ground, as it would restrain him from electioneering or disarm him of official influence if he should become active. soon after thishe wrote a letterthe expressions of which weresusceptible of being construed into a willingness to resign if permitted to stay in a given time. This was immediately noticed, & he was informed he should be indulged in time, asI informed youby letter at the time. but he instantly replied that his meaning in the letter had been quite misunderstood & that he never had meant to offer a resignation. we could not therefore persist in imputing to him an intention to resign contrary to his own express declaration, and his case resumed the same ground on which it had been before and on which all others stood, to wit, a tenure depending on future conduct. the deaths, resignations, and removals for malversation or active hostility to the constituted authorities, have now nearly reduced the participation of office to a just state, so far as respects those offices in my immediate gift, and will ere long give us our just measure. how it is in subordinate offices I know not, as I do not interfere with them. that there should be a general sweep is too contrary to our own declarations on the exclusive principles of the preceding administration. if it was wrong for them to exclude their opponents from all office, it would be equally wrong for us to do it. I have no doubt of the pressure on you on the subject of removal. but few persons care about it; but these few feel strongly. the principles and measures of conducting the affairs of the nation are what is chiefly interesting to the nation at large. who are the subordinate agents, provided the business is well done, is of less concern with them. a candid attention to the rights of the minority is a sacred duty, and I am not of opinion that the majority of our country wish them to be violated, or would fail to disapprove it.\nWe have reason to consider as certain the information in the papers that thedeposit at New Orleanswas restored on the 17th. of May. it was in consequence of anexpress order from the king of Spainsent to us by a vessel of war, and delivered by our Messenger in N. Orleans on the 12th. or 13th. of May. we hourly expect official information of it. believing certainly that war between France & England is inevitable, I have considerable confidence it will be the means of giving us all the security we can wish on the Missisipi, even if the other motives to do this should have not been listened to. Accept my wishes for your health & happiness & assurances of my esteem & attachment.\nTh: Jefferson"

    "content": "Randolph [Vt.] 23 January 1799\nHonored Sir—\nWith great pleasure & deference do I contemplate your high character—Every true American must esteem & respect you as beingraised upon the Kingdom of Providence, the political Father of our country—to fill the very first offices of public trust, with great respectability & the most distinguished usefulness to the ten thousands of our nation—and to fill a page in history, unequalled in lustre among the annals of mankind—which can never fail to communicate the most pleasing instruction to posterity—So much I beg leave to say with modesty, humility & gratitude—And pray dear Sir, permit me to lay before you a very short sketch of my life, which now is & has been for three years past, little else than a tale of woe & sorrow—Wish so to express myself as to be truly inoffensive.\nThe place of my nativity is a town called Haddons lying on and near the mouth of Connecticut river—From my 17th to my 22d year was chiefly in the service of my country—was taken prisoner twice A.D. 1779 at sea by the British, the first time was sat on shore in Virginia at the mouth of Chesepeak-bay—the second time was carried into New-york, & in November exchanged & sat on shore at Boston—having lost my little all of property.\nIn April 1780 began my studies for a public education at Dartmouth College—graduated Septemr 1785—was indented into the gospel ministry in Septemr 1786 by a public ordination over about 70 or 80 families newly settling this central town in Vermont, called Randolph—in population it has flourished gready, now there are 278 families & 1600 souls, but its finances are much embarrassed owing to the perplexed state of the proprietorship & its rapid settlement.\nServed my people in good harmony and with general success for ten years—On the 3d day of January 1798 resigned my ministerial office among my people in an amiable manner, it being only on account of bodily infirmity—My people has been as kind as is usual in similar cases—They still wish to have me preach to them whenever able—and consequently have given them two or three sermons the late summer, but in great feebleness.\nMy family consists of a kind Partner whom I married January A.D. 1788 the daughter of Joseph Marsh Esqr. of Hartford in this State, and three daughters & two sons between the age of ten & three years—also an indented lad ⟨of⟩ 14 years of age—all sprightly & active, & in common health, except myself.\nThe history of my infirmity is truly affecting—In 1794 was taken with very distressing rheumatic pain in the goint of my left hip—It was severe by spells and disenabled me from walking, except bycrutches, but not from performing my parochial duties till August A.D. 1796—when an able Surgeon laid my hip open, examined the bone, found it carious & judged my case remediless for some weeks—from that day to this the incisions have constantly discharged matter, distressing pain has attended me in that place every day, except intervals of relief obtained by the use ofopium—and my situation has been very feeble & inervated, have been able only to ride abroad a little now & then till a few months of late, I have gained more strength & acquired a little more ease—My prospects are more animating, so that probably, within a year, or two I may attain to a comfortable state of health, should nothing more extraordinary befall me—But now I have continual pain except while under the operation of my anodyne & in constant need of dressings for my sores—Doctors I have dismissed & wait on nature & time with patience—The good hand of Providence which laid calamity on me, has given me great resolution and fortitude, so that I continue to this day, an object of sympathy & compassion—cannot adequately describe the scene of sorrow & distress which I have gone thro’ for three years past.\nConfined from business, continually at expense—resources of support for my family impaired & cut off—benefactors have been kind, but still unavoidable bills of expense have accrued & still remain due—Creditors impatient for their pay—My little farm consisting of about 90 acres, about 35 of which under very indifferent & impaired cultivation—no property to hire labor with, the calls of my family still continue—we study the most prudent œconomy & industry, and admit of nothing superfluous, or ostentatious—nevertheless we are reduced to a state of indigency which is truly distressing and pitiable—it shakes my resolution at times—it draws forth the most fervent supplications for relief—Five hundred dollars would enable us soon to attain to that decent & plain style of living beyond which my heart does not aspire, after my late scene, which has taught me contentment with small things—A less sum from the benevolent hand of charity would awaken every sentiment of gratitude in my breast—& give us relief accordingly.\nPray dear Sir, if agreeable & consistent let your kind hand of benevolence lend us some small relief—perhaps a good word with some other great characters, may dispose them to become kind benefactors & send me a little relief also—No one can hardlyconceive what a thankful, obedient & grateful object you would relieve in such a case—how it would rejoice my heart & awaken every sentiment of respect & gratitude—I would be a faithful & responsible steward & endeavor to make such calculations & arrangements as to obtain the approbation & confidence of my benefactors.\nThus I have frankly & with sincerity opened my life & feelings—documents & testimonials of full authenticity are at hand of what ⟨I⟩ have written—at least, hope to obtain your sympathy & if guilty of any indelicacy or error, your forgiveness & patience.\nShall consign this to Mr Payne our Senator now ⟨in⟩ whose seat is only 12 miles from me, & whom I have reason ⟨to⟩ confide in as a good friend.\nThat the great Parent of all good may ever grant you his heavenly benedictions, prosperity & great felicity is the most fervent prayer of your dutiful, most obedient and humble servant\nElijah Brainerd"

    "content": "New York27th. Jany 1789.\nDear Sir,\nI have been here about a Fortnight during which time we have not made a Congress. So. Carolina, Virga, Pennsa, N. Jersey, & Massachussetsare represented. There is one Member from each of the States of Rhode Island, N. Carolina & Georgia, but none from New Hampshire, Connecticut N. York, Delaware or Maryland. I very much wish we may make a house in a week or ten days, as I think the Appearances in Europe, & perhaps even here, of the old Congress being in full operation and tranquilly yielding the seats to the new would have a good effect. The misrepresentations in Europe have been extremely gross, and must have an unfavorable effect upon Emigration in the poorer ranks of life. Col. Wadsworth has been mentiond as President. I respect him much, but I wish to give appearance to the old System by a Character of rather more celebrity. Mr. Adams would meet my Judgment better than any member of the present house. The principal Objection is his Absence, which I fear will deprive him of his chance.\nThe federal business in Pennsa. is happily closed. Our Electors, & Senators are all federal, & seven of our Reps. The eighth is a german, so that I doubt not he will feel the influence of the federalism of his countrymen which is actual, and he will also I think, from being rather fond of public office, feel the federalism of the state. His Sentiments were doubting if not opposed to the Constitution. He is a man of private virtue some Patriotism & judgment, and not ignorant of the Affairs of Pennsylvania. In our state politics he has been a constitutionalist latterly a mild one, that is a prudent politician.\nThe State of New York still retain their impressions against the Constitution. They still decline to elect Senators upon legislative principles, and I think an absence of two of the Senate is, from Appearances determined on to avoid the precedent of conceding their due legislative independence. They will have two antifdlts, and no Merchant on their Senate. Massachussets & Pennsa. alone have attended to mercantile character in the Senate, which will assist in obviating the Objections to the commercial powers of that body. This is in favor of the Constitution, but possibly not so favorable to the interests of the Union as if there were five or six merchants. The practice under the Constitution will, in my opinion, be more agreeable to the Opposition in many other particulars than their leaders are aware of. In this particular instance it is fortunate that our Senator is a man of extensive political information, and landed property and, tho a practical Merchant, a friend to a pretty free System of Trade. I do not think the most captious agriculturist in the Senate will find Mr. Morris tenacious of any principle that will be injurious to the landed interest.\nThe election of New Jersey for Electors is federal. This with the choice of their Senators augurs well with regard to the reps. I do not find any doubt that there will be two fedts. among them, most probably three and I think very probably four. The federalism of Jersey, and its obligations and inducements to adhere to the union & a vigorous system of federal politics will be a pretty strong Security for the good Conduct of her Representatives.\nThe re-election of a federalist for a Senator by new Hampshire is a symptom of the continuance of the Acquiescence of that State in the Constitution. Mr. Wingate I mean in the room of Mr. Bartlett. I find too they think of Mr. Adams as V. P. which also shews there is no violent discontent. There are good Symptoms also in the Elections so far as known here. Massachussetts seems also to evince feelings equally favorable, and Connecticut still more. I understand however from Dr. Johnson that the latter State mean to remove all their Senators & reps. from all state offices. This tho merely from general republican reasons will probably lose us an individual or two of the Senate & house of Reps. Mr. Ellsworth, and I think Mr. Sherman are of the state Judiciary. They will be great losses to the government, if they adhere to their state Appointments. Delaware has given us federalists altogether, and I believe Maryland. From this detail, of wch. I presume you knew the greater part before I think the Government will be well supported from the North side of the Powtowmack, even in the house of Reps. New York by her districts will have two federalists & very able ones I hope.\nThe Election of Virga. is an Object of great Anxiety with me—not that I hope or fear much, for I presume the ticket will have a very moderate portion of federalism. But, Sir, when [I] examine the list of representatives & see how few are yet returned and how few are likely to be returned to that house, who are able to take the lead in a scene of that kind I confess I feel some apprehensions about the advantages the opposition may gain from the Speakers of your state, and the greatest solicitude lest we should be deprived of that support which your ticket may give us. I most sincerely hope this will find your own election secured. The Senate was in my mind not the place in which the cause required you to be in any point of view, but one that there seemed little probability that your legislature would favor the pretensions of any federalist unless they would elect you. Your election would be a gain therefore, wch. could not perhaps be otherwise secured, but the Senate was never the place where my fears rested. I therefore felt little regret atthe issue of the choice by your state. The house of Representatives is a scene of the utmost importance. If happily conducted little is to be feared—if it proves unfriendly great talents—great exertions—great public estimation in favor of our leading friends will be necessary to prevent the most serious evils—if it cannot be induced to countenance the constitution the unanimity of the Senate would, under present circumstance avail but little.\nThe election of the President seems likely to be unanimous. It is perhaps the greatest personal point that will ever occur in this Country, that it be secure—and I feel the most cordial satisfaction in considering it beyond all hazard. The Office of V. P. seems destined for Mr. Adams, who will have nearly all Pennsa, Delaware & New England probably Jersey. Mr. Rutlege I understand will be pushed by S. Carolina, and Mr Jay who is the only candidate besides that is talked off [sic] will have but little support in this Matter left. He appears to have no Views himself. Tho well qualified for more important station than the proper Duties of the VP. render that yet I think it would be wrong to draw him for the Office of foreign affairs. Our treaties are all unformed—he alone knows the whole Negociations—he is among the very few who have been in the way of qualifying themselves for foreign negotiation. He is much esteemed in Pennsa. but her votes & influence would be exerted against him in the present state of the question on the seat of Government. Mr. Adams is esteemed by the people—has high ideas of Government—is a friend to property—will take the feelings of New England with him—has been used to the forms of legislative & diplomatic business—he is a man of a pure private Character, & has knowlege & abilities beyond the proper duties of a V. P. which indeed are not very important. He will lose few votes, I think from the North side of Maryland (where also he is seriously thought of) but from an apprehension that he may outrun the genl. or hazard the election of the latter. This tho in my mind a very small hazard indeed I am pleased to observe is foreseen, and will be attended to.\nMr. Dawson assures me this letter will reach you if sent to the Office at Fredericksburg which is the Reason of my sending that way. I am with very great truth dear Sir, yr. respectful & aff. h. Servt.\nTench Coxe"

What effect this last event will have on the affairs of Europe, cannot be foreseen, the character of the successor beingabsolutely unknown. He is 24. years of age. One would conjecture that if he has any dispositions to war, he would think a little time necessary to get his election passed in form, to see if the troubles within his dominions quieted by his father would be likely to break out or not &c. and that this would hold him back one campaign. Still this event renders peace less certain, as the character of his father was so decidedly pacific, that one might count on that. There seems to have been a magnificent story current in London for the three or four last days of March, of the capture of Seringapatam, and Tippoo Saib, great slaughter &c. but on the 1st. of April the date of the latest paper which the vessel brings (she is from Glasgow), it had died away to ahum, raised by Stockjobbers who wanted to sell out. It did in fact raise East India stock 2. or 3. per cent. Still it was not fallen into entire discredit, as appears by some paragraphs and consequently cannot be decidedly pronounced untrue.

The river being uncommonly full afforded an opportunity to judge what work is yet wanting for the complete introduction of its water to the Wheel at alltimes. What I saw and judged I cannot refrain from communicating as I mentioned rather inconsiderately the report of the neighbourhood inmy last, as unfavorable as it was, and as likely to be incorrect. The current does not enter the Canal at all, for the first water which goes in receiving a check immediately from the narrowness & curvature of the channell and the unevenness of the sides becomes still and the current afterwards passes wholly by, not inclining in the least towards the Canals mouth. It is manifest that this must be completely remedied by the extension of the little jettee at the mouth and the throwing out another on the opposite side above: the main current must then get directly in the Canal. By the accounts of some, the Canal begins to have water in it when the river has risen about six inches above the state next to the lowest, which was its condition three days since. The water does not till it has continued to rise a short time perhaps till it has risen one foot higher, get well down to the mill. There are two places in its bottom too high; they are both between the middle point and the bridge and both in the part where the earth has been thrown from the greatest depth; where the long job of blowing last fall was done: some say neither of these elevations extends farther than four or five yards: Lillie believes not more than 10 or 12 feet. From the last of these there is a rapid current down to the mill at which the present state of the river would give a head as high as the eaves, all admitt, if the bank had not given way 300 yards above. The wheel begins to be completely submerged about the time the last rock in the ford from Shadwell to Monticello is covered. It is believed that it would turn with rapidity sufficient to grind well when covered 12 inches. The Jettees, a mere trifle of blowing and the increase of the bank about the forebay and at one place above, seem to be all the work wanting to make it the best Mill in the County. At present the water runs back into the river when it falls from the obstructions I mention & shews no current from the bend near the entrance to that place. The Wheel has been set in motion today & moved with great velocity when 4 inches covered. Lillie was determined to grind some grain before night—The N. orleansnewsMr Eppes and myself return thanks for. The Ladies and all the children are perfectly well.\nWith sincere attachment\nTh: M.Randolph"

Having heard nothing from either of you since—as Mrs Washington is now on her way home—and as it would be very convenient for me, that she should procure at Philadelphia some Articles of Furniture, and stores for my House in Virginia, if they are to be met with I am in a manner compelled, very contrary to my inclination to ask if she could be furnished with about 1500 Doll. for these purposes—If this sum is supplied her I will give a warrant upon the pay Chest or Account for it in any manner you shall direct, agreeably to the Tenor of your letter of the 20th of August last.\nMrs Washington accepts the kind invitation which you and Mrs Morris have been Obliging enough to give during the few days she may stay in Philadelphia and I can only repeat, with the usual sincerity, the pleasure I should feel in having you and Mrs Morris if she inclines to honor Princeton with her Company, and can put up with Batchelors fare with me under my Roof.

It being understood that the Lords of Appeal will consent to hear all the Treaty Cases, whether in course or not, as soon as they can be made ready, I have taken every possible means to have them immediately prepared for hearing, and doubt not of being able to procure Decrees in time to lay them before the Commissioners previous to the 15th. of July; But if from any circumstances not to be provided for, one or two should then be undecided, the Board will doubtless consent to consider and refer them for Report de Bene Esse.\nFrom this state of the Business, I derive the most sanguine confidence that the labors of the commission will terminate as early as August or in September, at farthest. It is scarcely possible to do justice to the great Zeal and Exertions of Mr. Pinkney who has thus expedited our Business in a manner not to have been expected. A very important omission in the Convention, had given rise to a difference of Opinion at the Board, as to whether Interest should be allowed on our Claims during the time in which its functions were suspended; this has delayed the execution of Awards: but tho there was no specific provision in the Convention to this Effect, yet Mr. Pinkney found in the spirit of the Instrument, that the powers of the Commissioners were adequate to the purpose of making such allowance; his decision and firmness upon this subject (probably somewhat assisted by the Circumstances of the Times) has finally succeeded; and the Board is now executing Awards: the difference of Interest thus obtained may be estimated on the Mass of our Claims at about 100,000£ Sterling. Mr. Pinkney’s argument upon this occasion may be interesting & I therefore take the liberty of enclosing a Copy herewith.\nThe Form of the Award has been lately much simplyfied, which⟨wi⟩ll be particularly advantageous in that it must facilitate the transfer, and consequently raise the value of the Instruments. It is probable also that the Mode of assigning to the British Government our Claims upon the Captors, will be advantageously altered; instead of an assignment on each seperate Award, a single Instrument, and referring to a Schedule is proposed; this Schedule is to contain the particulars of the Awards relating to which, Claims upon the Captors are to be assigned.\nThe Gross amount of the Awards may be estimated at about[. . .]million Sterling; as soon as the proper Lists can be completed⟨I sh⟩all have the honor to transmit them to you.\nFinding that the Claimants generally are not⟨w⟩ell informed of the Nature and course of the Business here, of the Duties of the public Agent, and very many, not even of the terms of the Convention, I have thought it proper to send to them a Circular Letter, a copy of which I take the liberty of enclosing. I have the honor to be Sir With the most perfect Respect, Your very Obedt. Servt.\nGeorge W Erving"

    "content": "Boston, Aug. 20, 1774\nIn the county of Worcester, the people, at a general meeting, have resolved that no court shall be held there, according to the new regulation of juries, and that judge Oliver shall not take his seat. Upon a report that a regiment would be sent to protect the court, they declared that they were ready to meet it. It is to be hoped, however, that no violent measures will be taken, till the sense of the whole continent is known; as the people have great dependence upon the determinations of congress, and expect them to chalk out the line for their conduct. As to the soldiers here, they are no more feared than if they were the troops of Lilliput. Indeed, they are much more disposed to flight than combat, and have more inclination to desert to us than to fight us—above two hundred having already left them. To put a stop to these frequent desertions, the officers are obliged to treat them with great severity—death or 1000 lashes, is the only choice offered to those who are retaken. There is a humorous story told about town of one of the deserters, though I cannot say it is absolutely to be depended upon as a fact: a soldier, whose name is Patrick, deserted sometime ago and settled in a country town at some distance, and there undertook to instruct a company of about fifty men in military exercises. A sergeant and eight men were sent to apprehend deserters, got intelligence of him, and agreed with a countryman, for a couple of guineas, to conductthem to him. Patrick, it seems, was at that time exercising his company; however, being called by the sergeant and his men, he immediately came up to them. The sergeant demanded what he did there, told him he was his prisoner, and ordered him to return and join his regiment. Sir, said Patrick, I beg your pardon, but I don’t think it possible for me to obey you at present. The sergeant repeated his orders in a very peremptory style. Patrick still assured him of the great improbability of his being able to comply with the command; but told him, as it was not absolutely certain, he would see what could be done about it. You must know, said he, that we determine every thing here by a vote—and turning to his company, which had by this time come up,—gentlemen, says he, if it be your mind that I should leave the town and return to my regiment, please to manifest it. Not a single hand appeared in favor of the motion. He then desired that those who were contrary-minded should manifest it, which passednem. con. The sergeant and his men, finding themselves in so small a minority, and seeing it in vain to oppose the general voice of the meeting, were about to return again in peace, when one or two of his men were desirous to have it put to vote whether they should not stay also. Patrick, as moderator, immediately put the question, which it was not difficult to carry in such an assembly, and the sergeant, knowing it vain to resist, returned with six men to his regiment."

Since which I have been induced by the Situation of our Affairs to the Northward in Addition to the above Numbers to order out 500 of the Militia from the Northern Parts of Ulster and Dutchess Counties 1000 from the County of Albany and 500 from the County of Tryon to reinforce the Army under Command of General Schuyler and to continue in Service until the first Day of November next unless your Excellency shall think proper to dismiss them before —Those from the two former Counties I have Reason to believe are by this Time on their March but I have not yet been advised what Success they have experienced in getting the Proportion allotted for the other Counties I fear not so good as could be wished the People in that Quarter consider their Western Frontier equally liable to the Incursions of the Enemy and influenced by this Consideration are Unwilling to leave their Families exposed and join our Army—as the Enemy advance many of the best of the Inhabitants are employed in moving off their Familes and Effects—Indeed I have always observed that the Militia of any Part of the Country most in Danger are for theabove Reasons least forward in opposing an Enemy some too decline acting under those Circumstances from unworthy Principles.\nYour Excellency’s Letter of the 1st Instant Dated at Chester I received in Kingston on Wednesday last and thereupon ordered 4 Regiments of Militia to this Post 3 to join Genl Putnam at Peek’s Kill and one to occupy the Post at the Mouth of the Clove the last of those ordered here arrived Yesterday and I learn from General Putnam that those designed for him are also arrived at Peeks Kill. All the Remainder of the Militia of the State are under Marching Orders. I never knew the Militia come out with greater Alacrity but as many of them yet have great Part of their Harvests in the Field I fear it will be difficult to detain them long unless the Enemy make some Movements that indicate a Design of coming this Way suddenly and so obvious as to be believed by the Militia. I can’t but express my Surprize that no Reinforcements (as I have heard) have yet arrived to our Northern Army from the Eastward. The Want of Confidence in the General Officers to the Northward is the specious Reason—to me it appears a very weak one—the mutilated and destressed Condition of this State renders our utmost Exertions to oppose the Common Enemy in Appearance but little better than one half of it being out of our Possession. Common Gratitude to a Sister State as well as Duty to the Continent at large conspire in calling on our Eastern Neighbours to step forth on this Occasion and more especially as they only are in a Situation Totally to destroy General Burgoyne’s Army by intercepting his Supplies and even cutting off his Retreat to the Lakes.\nThe Detachment of 810 for this Garrison and Peeks Kill are not yet compleated owing to the Body of the Militia being so suddenly called out, but will be effected immediately on their Return Home ’till which Time I will endeavor to detain and equal Number of them here.\nI have not yet received the late Resolves of Congress for recruiting the Army alluded to in your Excellency’s Letter of the 4th Instant—as soon as they come to Hand I will do every Thing in my Power to render them effectual and forward the requested Information. I am with much Esteem Your Excellency’s most obed. servt\nGeo: Clinton"

As this Enterprize will therfore mostprobably be laid aside for the present it may be proper for Capt. Whipple to keep his Station a few Days longer for the Packet.

From this interval and your not acknowledging some of my letters I suspect that our correspondence suffers from some fault in the post office. This has certainly been the case with letters between Col. Grayson and myself. The part of your letter which has engaged most of my attention is the postscript which invites me to a ramble this fall. I have long had it in contemplation, to seize occasions as they may arise, of traversing the Atlantic States as well as of taking a taste of the Western curiosities. A visit to the Eastern States which I have never seen formed the first article in my plan, and I had allotted to it the season which I otherwise employed last year.A trip in to Canada would also be agreeable. With these prepossessions, you may well suppose, I read your invitation with a sufficient disposition to accept it. There are several considerations however which oblige me to hesitate. My resources do not authorize me to disregard that of the expence, though this shall never be a decisive objection, but when it is an essential one: the possibility of my being called on to attend a public duty which has been imposed on me —the inconveniency of sparing so much time. To these general objections particular ones occur. The time at which the Western treaty will actually be held must be extremely uncertain; great delays ought to be presupposed as happened in the last one at Fort Stanwix, and a return might be obstructed by the lowness of the waters, by the want of boats at our command, or by the necessity of travelling back thro’ the Wilderness via Kentucky; these circumstances compared with the time at which my attendance will be due at Richmond, seem to forbid my acceding to your first proposition. The second, to wit, a ramble towards Montreal & Quebec, is objectionable also on account of the time it would require; not to mention that the present may not be the crisis at which a Citizen of the U. States would travel with most satisfaction through that country. The Eastern ramble which is the third you suggest, has also its difficulties, though they are the least insurmountable. In the first place, your expressions leave me in doubt whether it would be agreeable to yourself or not; in the next, I should consider it as indispensable to go by land, and not by water from New York. The latter mode would not answer the purpose of a traveller; and I am not sure that the former is attainable without carrying horses from Virginia: and in the last place, it is possible as observed above, that I may be called by matters of a public nature from such a project of pleasure. Notwithstanding these difficulties, I will make some eventual arrangements, suspending a positive determination till I hear again from you, which I hope will be as early as an answer can come by the post. At all events it is not unlikely that I may be obliged to ride as far as Philada. where I should be very happy if we could meet in case your final plans should make it convenient. Besides a public undertaking which maypossiblyrequire such a ride, I have in conjunction with a friend here a project on the anvil, which may furnish a motive of interest. I am Dear Sir Yr. affectionate friend\nJ. Madison Jr.\nI thank you particularly for the Journals of Congress."

Bassetts tomorrow & lose no time in getg home where she will Stay but a few days, before she sets out for the Camp—I think her stay in New Kent so long after she had your invitation to come to you, was rather ill judge’d, & will I fear occasion her haveg a very desagreeable journey—I suppose one way or other she will make it near the 20th before she will set off—I will do all I can to get her off sooner if Possible. In my last I inform’d you I had reciev’d your letter of the 12th Octbr Express by Mr Milner —as yet there is nothing done (or at least very little) about Stopg the Navagation of Potowmack—I have said and done all that was in my power, & have lost the whole week in going backwards & forwards indeavourg to prevail upon them to do something—most people say it is impractible & I fear it will be found to be so—however Captn Boucher, Captn Conwey & Captn John West are gone down the River to Measure the width & deapth of the Channel, & we then shall be better able to judge—all the sea fareg men Say there is no part of the Channel Narrower than ¼ of a mile, except Cedar point, & Mr Diggs, and at the former there is 16 or 18 fathom water & at the latter near as much—Boucher I have not seen lately, once I heard him say it might be done with 3 Ships Sunk—it seems you are Mistaken in the Channel below quantico it is but shallow but very wide, & it is remark’d in any part of the River where the Channel is narrow, it is very deep. I have just reciev’d two letters from you Octbr 15th & 23d. I can Assure you I never knew What you was to give Mercer for his Wheat, nor was I privy to any part of your Agreement about it consequently was totally Ignorant What kind of money you was to pay him—Mr Mercer wrote to me, that you had promise’d to pay Mr Brent for him £135. & that you had directed Colo. Lewis to pay him money beside in Wmsburg at the meetg of the Merchants, to confirm this he inclose’d me a Letter from you to him, wherein you Speak of payg Mr Brents Rent after the meetg of the Merchts & that you had directed Colo. Lewis to let him have money, but does not say What sum—Colo. Lewis at the sametime wrote to me tellg me that the disappointment that he met with in recieveg money at Wmsburg for you, prevented his letg Mercer have money as you had directed him, & that he had advise’d Mercer to apply to me for it, Mercer in his letter pointed out the sum you had promised (for neither your letter or Lewis mention’d it) which was £200 in the Whole (Brent & himself) judge you whether I coud do other ways than believe you had made such a promise, I immediately grew anxious to comply with it—wrote to mercer that you sold your commodities in long Currency & if—he woud receive half-joes at 48/ & Dollars at 6/ I woud pay the money, he answerd he woud take half-joes of 9 p. Wt at 46/ & no more for he coud not pass them at more, Silver Dollars & 6/ but not paper, but Mr Brent might do as he pleasd, but he thought it might suit Brent to take Money at the above rates his payments being in the uper part of the Country I wrote to Brent. he woud take Silver Dollars—but Gold no other ways than by Wt—I paid Brent £98.5.—30 some ood pound in Gold by Wt the rest in silver Dollars—& if I coud have met with an opportunity shoud have sent the Ballance to mercer in Gold by Wt but not meetg with one until I got Dollars, nor indeed until Mrs Washington Went down—I sent it by her to diliver to Colo. Lewis desireg him to pay the money to mercer & take his rect at the same time tellg him he knew the Sum Mr Mercer was to recieve of you by him—for I did not. When John West applyd for money he sent me your Bond to shew the justness of his demand, at the same time apologiseg for his Askg paymt as you were not hear. as al others do who ask. I find my self equally anxious to discharge a Debt against you, as I am to pay one of my own, I sometimes am askd for small sums which they say you owe them, it may be true or false I cannot tell, but it destresses me, for I woud that you shoud owe no man, John Lowe the barber says you owe him 7/6 for a false tale for your hair—if I thought you owe’d it, I wou’d pay it, I tould him you woud have paid such a wretch as him upon recieveg the tale but enough of this, in money matters as in all other things I will do the best I can.\nJames Cleveland Came here the 3d Inst. It appears by his Certificates that the Worck done upon the large tract upon the Great Kanhawa is Valued at £1100.15.7½ (10990 Acres) and upon the tract laying above the Rapid at the Great Bend uponthe Ohio consistg of 4395 Acres—Valued at £468.3. He woud have gladly staid & finishd the whole worck this fall, but the unsetled State the Indians were in before the treaty made it dangerous —he had at the request of the principle people in that part of the world move’d up, as many Others did to wheeling, where he hired his people, & came himself up the River with his Servts to sell them, & get Instructions from Crauford where he cou’d find your other tracts of land—this being done he returnd to wheelg. there the people recieved an Express desirg that none woud go down the River, it being thought dangerous, as the Indians had burnt the Fort at the Great Kanhawa and all the improvements that had been made on the Several tracts of Land in that part of the world—this determine’d him to come away with all the people (Stephens & Skilling excepted) Who he directed to go down the River & gather and secure the Corn & if possible despose of it to the Garison, which was to be somewhere below—the Tools with 40MNails he lodge’d with the Commandg officer at Wheelg who promised to take care of them—he thinks there will be 150 Barrels of Corn. He sold 6 Servts for £153.10. Virg. money & one for a Rifle Gun & 40/—2 got drown’d & one made his Escape by run[nin]g off—The one he got the gun for was sold at the Great Kanhawa he found he cou’d not keep him, and it was all he coud get. The Negroes (Simpson haveg no use for them) he left with will Crauford he haveg given from under his hand that he will alow for them what ever may be judge’d they are worth dureg the time they Stay there or until you direct in what manner they shall be employd—the Money for the Servts is to be paid upon the dilivery of their indentures, I think it will be best to direct it to be paid to Simpson as he is in want of money—Cleveland says he will get the Mill to go Soon: I believe you will not be despleased with the heaviness of the worck in the dineg Room when you come to see it—it does not look heavy, but it is a kind of worck that goes on slow, the man is still at it, & will be for a fortnight—Sears has been long absent very sick—came here yesterday not well—I suppose there is very little Chance of getg the painter from Lord Dunmore, if he comes up here and indeavours to Land at mt Vernon Raising the rest, I will shoot him, that will be some Satisfaction, I shall take care to plant the Bryer Berrys, Ithought of it before, I was under a necessaty to Indorse the Bills or they woud not sell I try’d all I cou’d to avoid it. I have taken much pains to get Sping Wheels but really cou’d not get them there is a man or two in Alexandria that makes them but they have been unable to worck these two months (fevers & Ague) beside they are in such demand there is hardly any such thing as getg them, we have got two, & I expe[c]t to get on monday next, our old ones which have long been in a shop at Alexandria & one more new one, so that we shall then have 7 & we must indeavour to make up for lost time —the Wash House is going on—the Chimneys is now Carrying up, I have had a great Inclination to alter the Doors, but am unwilg to make an alteration in any thing that you have directed—it will not look well being different from the Kitchen. I shoud have been happy to see you this winter, but as fate have order’d it otherwise, it must be so, God grant you health & Success—remember me to Harrison & Henley. our family at present are all pretty Well. Am your Affectionate & very Humble Servt\nLund Washington\nExcuse Blunder or incorrectness for I have but a short time to write in the Post leaves Alexandria before 10. oClock & I chose to send for your Letters before I began to wrote—you will find by the papers we have had a Small Skirmish at Hampton—but no American Blood Spilt, but some on the other side —I hope if any of those mischievous tinders comes up this River we shall be able to Render a good ac[coun]t of them—perhaps I may not write again until Mrs Washington comes."

    "content": "Quincy, November 4, 1809.\nSirs,\nIn my last letter I mentioned the following\nMEMORIAL\nTo their High Mightinesses, the States General of the United Provinces of the Low Countries.\nHigh and Mighty Lords,\nThe subscriber has the honour, to propose to your High Mightinesses, that the United States of America, in Congress assembled, have lately thought fit to send him a Commission (with full powers and instructions) to confer with your H. M. concerning a treaty of amity and commerce, an authentic copy of which he has the honour to annex to this Memorial.\nAt the times when the treaties between this republic and the crown of Great Britain were made, the people, who now compose the United States of America, were a part of the English nation; as such, allies of the republic, and parties to those treaties; entitled to all their benefits, and submitting cheerfully to all their obligations.\nIt is true, that when the British administration, renouncing the ancient character of Englishmen for generosity, justice and humanity, conceived the design of subverting the political systems of the colonies; depriving them of the rights and liberties of Englishmen, and reducing them to the worst of all forms of government, starving the people by blockading the ports, and cutting off their fisheries and commerce; sending fleets and armies to destroy every principle and sentiment of liberty, and to consume their habitations and their lives; making contracts for foreign troops, and alliances with savage nations to assist them in their enterprise; casting formally, by act of parliament, three millions of people at once out of the protection of the crown; then, and not till then, did the United States of America, in Congress assembled, pass that memorable act, by which they assumed an equal station among the nations.\nThis immortal declaration, of the 4th of July, 1776, when America was invaded by an hundred vessels of war, and, according to estimates laid before parliament, by 55,000 of veteran troops, was not the effect of any sudden passion, or enthusiasm; but a measure which had been long in deliberation among the people, maturely discussed in some hundreds of popular assemblies, and by public writings in all the states: it was a measure which congress did not adopt until they had received the positive instructions of their constituents in all the states: it was then unanimously adopted by congress, subscribed by all its members, transmitted to the assemblies of the several states, and by them respectively accepted, ratified and recorded among their archives; so that no decree, edict, statute, placart or fundamental law of any nation was ever made with more solemnity, or with more unanimity or cordiality adopted, as the act and consent of the whole people, than this: and it has been held sacred to this day by every state, with such unshaken firmness, that not even the smallest has ever been induced to part from it: although the English have wasted many millions, and vast fleets and armies, in the vain attempt so invalidate it. On the contrary, each of the thirteen states has instituted a form of government for itself under the authority of the people; has erected its legislature in the several branches; its executive authority with all its offices; its judiciary department and judges; its army, militia, revenue, and some of them their navy: and all those departments of government have been regularly and constitutionally organized under the associated superintendency of congress, now these five years, and have acquired a consistency, solidity and activity equal to the oldest and most established governments. It is true, that in some speeches and writings of the English it is still contended, that the people of America are still in principle and affection with them: but these assertions are made against such evident truth and demonstration, that it is surprising they should find at this day one believer in the world. One may appeal to the writings and recorded speeches of the English for the last seventeen years, to shew, that similar misrepresentations have been incessantly repeated through that whole period, and that the conclusion of every year has in fact confuted the confident assertions and predictions of the beginning of it. The subscriber begs leave to say from his own knowledge of the people of America, (and he has a better right to obtain credit, because he has better opportunity to know, than any Briton whatsoever) that they are unalterably determined to maintain their independence. He confesses, that notwithstanding his confidence through his whole life in the virtuous sentiments and uniformity of character among his countrymen, their unanimity has surprised him: that all the power, arts, intrigues and bribes, which have been employed in the several states, should have seduced from the standard of virtue so contemptible a few, is more fortunate than could have been expected. This independence stands upon so broad and firm a bottom of the people’s interests, honour, consciences and affections, that it will not be affected by any successes the English may obtain either in America, or against the European powers at war, nor by any alliances they can possibly form; if indeed in so unjust and desperate a cause they can obtain any. Nevertheless, although compelled by necessity, and warranted by the fundamental laws of the colonies, and of the British constitution, by principles avowed in the English laws, and confirmed by many examples in the English history, by principles interwoven into the history and public right of Europe, in the great examples of the Helvetic and Belgic confederacies, and many others; and frequently acknowledged and ratified by the diplomatic body, principles founded in eternal justice, and the laws of God and nature, to cut asunder forever, all the ties which had connected them with Great Britain: yet the people of America did not consider themselves as separating from their allies, especially the republic of the United Provinces, or departing from their connexions with any of the people under their government; but, on the contrary, they preserved the same affection, esteem and respect for the Dutch nation, in every part of the world, which they and their ancestors had ever entertained.\nWhen sound policy dictated to congress the precaution of sending persons to negotiate natural alliances in Europe, it was not from a failure in respect that they did not send a Minister to your High Mightinesses, with the first whom they sent abroad: but instructed in the nature of the connections between Great Britain and the republic, and in the system of peace and neutrality, which she had so long pursued, they thought proper to respect both so far, as not to seek or embroil her with her allies, to excite divisions in the nation, or lay embarrassments before it. But, since the British Administration, uniform and persevering in injustice, despising their allies, as much as their colonists and fellow subjects; disregarding the faith of treaties, as much as that of royal charters; violating the law of nations, as they had before done the fundamental laws of the colonies and the inherent rights of British subjects, have arbitrarily set aside all the treaties between the crown and the republic, declared war and commenced hostilities, the settled intentions of which they had manifested long before; all those motives, which before restrained the congress, cease: and an opportunity presents of proposing such connections, as the United States of America have a right to form, consistent with the treaties already formed with France and Spain, which they are under every obligation of duty, interest and inclination to observe sacred and inviolate; and consistent with such other treaties, as it is their intention to propose to other sovereigns.\nIf there was ever among nations a natural alliance, one may be formed between the two republics. The first planters of the four northern states found in this country an asylum from persecution, and resided here from the year one thousand six hundred and eight to the year one thousand six hundred and twenty, twelve years preceding their migration. They ever entertained and have transmitted to posterity, a grateful remembrance of that protection and hospitality, and especially of that religious liberty they found here, having sought it in vain in England.\nThe first inhabitants of two other states, New-York and New-Jersey, were immediate emigrants from this nation, and have transmitted their religion, language, customs, manners and character: and America in general, until her connections with the house of Bourbon, has ever considered this nation as her first friend in Europe, whose history, and the great characters it exhibits, in the various arts of peace, as well as achievements of war by sea and land, have been particularly studied, admired and imitated in every state.\nA similitude of religion, although it is not deemed so essential in this as in former ages to the alliance of nations, is still, as it ever will be thought, a desirable circumstance. Now it may be said with truth, that there are no two nations, whose worship, doctrine and discipline, are more alike than those of the two republics. In this particular therefore, as far as it is of weight, an alliance would be perfectly natural.\nA similarity in the forms of government, is usually considered as another circumstance, which renders alliances natural: and although the constitutions of the two republics are not perfectly alike, there is yet analogy enough between them, to make a connection easy in this respect.\nIn general usages, and in the liberality of sentiments in those momentous points, the freedom of enquiry, the right of private judgment and the liberty of conscience, of so much importance to be supported in the world, and imparted to all mankind, and which at this hour are in more danger from Great Britain and that intolerant spirit which is secretly fomenting there, than from any other quarter, the two nations resemble each other more than any others.\nThe originals of the two republics are so much alike, that the history of one seems but a transcript from that of the other: so that every Dutchman instructed in the subject, must pronounce the American revolution just and necessary, or pass a censure upon the greatest actions of his immortal ancestors: actions which have been approved and applauded by mankind, and justified by the decision of Heaven.\nBut the circumstance, which perhaps in this age has stronger influence than any other in the formation of friendships between nations, is the great and growing interest of Commerce; of the whole system of which through the globe, your High Mightinesses are too perfect masters, for me to say any thing that is not familiarly known. It may not however be amiss to hint, that the central situation of this country, her extensive navigation, her possessions in the East and West-Indies, the intelligence of her merchants, the number of her capitalists, and the riches of her funds, render a connection with her very desirable to America:—and on the other hand, the abundance and variety of the productions of America, the materials of manufactures, navigation and commerce; the vast demand and consumption in America of the manufactures of Europe, of merchandises from the Baltic, and from the East-Indies, and the situation of the Dutch possessions in the West-Indies, cannot admit a doubt, that a connection with the United States would be useful to this republic. The English are so sensible of this, that notwithstanding all their professions of friendship, they have ever considered this nation as their rival in the American trade; a sentiment which dictated and maintained their severe act of navigation, as injurious to the commerce and naval power of this country, as it was both to the trade and the rights of the colonists.—There is now an opportunity offered to both, to shake off this shackle forever. If any consideration whatever could have induced them to have avoided a war with your High Mightinesses, it would have been the apprehension of an alliance between the two republics: and it is easy to foresee, that nothing will contribute more to oblige them to a peace, than such a connection once completely formed. It is needless to point out particularly, what advantages might be derived to the possessions of the republic in the West Indies from a trade opened, protected and encouraged between them and the continent of America; or what profits might be made by the Dutch East-India Company, by carrying their effects directly to the American market; or how much even the trade of the Baltic might be secured and extended by a free intercourse with America, which has ever had so large a demand, and will have more for hemp, cordage, sail-cloth and other articles of that commerce: how much the national navigation would be benefited by building and purchasing ships there: how much the number of seamen might be increased, or how much advantages to both countries, to have their ports mutually opened to their men of war and privateers and their prizes.\nIf therefore an analogy of religion, government, original, manners, and the most extensive and lasting commercial interests, can form a ground and an invitation to political connections, the subscriber flatters himself, that in all these particulars the union is so obviously natural, that there has seldom been a more distinct designation of providence to any two distant nations to unite themselves together.\nIt is further submitted to the wisdom and humanity of your High Mightinesses, whether it is not visibly for the good of mankind, that the powers of Europe, who are convinced of the justice of the American cause, (and where is one to be found that is not?) should make haste to acknowledge the Independence of the United States, and form equitable treaties with them, as the surest means of convincing G. Britain of the impracticability of her pursuits?—whether the late marine treaty concerning the rights of neutral vessels, noble and useful as it is, can be established against Great Britain, who will never adopt it, nor submit to it, but from necessity, without the independence of America? whether the return of America, with her nurseries of seamen and magazines of materials for navigation and commerce, to the domination and monopoly of Great Britain, if that were practicable, would not put the possessions of other nations beyond seas wholly in the power of that enormous empire, which has been long governed wholly by the feeling of its own power at least without a proportional attention to justice, humanity, or decency. When it is obvious and certain, that the Americans are not inclined to submit again to the British government, on the one hand, and that the powers of Europe ought not and could not with safety consent to it, if they were, on the other; why should a source of contention be lest open, for future contingencies to involve the nations of Europe in still more bloodshed, when, by one decisive step of the maritime powers, in making treaties with a nation long in possession of sovereignty by right and in fact, it might be closed?\nThe Example of your High Mightinesses would, it is hoped, be followed by all the maritime powers, especially those which are parties to the late marine treaty; nor can apprehension, that the independence of America would be injurious to the trade of the Baltic, be any objection. This jealousy is so groundless, that the reverse would happen. The freight and insurance in voyages across the Atlantic are so high, and the price of labor in America so dear, that tar, pitch, turpentine and ship timber never can be transported to Europe at so cheap a rate, as it has been and will be afforded by countries round the Baltic. This commerce was supported by the English before the revolution with difficulty, and not without large Parliamentary bounties. Of hemp, cordage and sail cloth there will not probably be a sufficiency raised in America for her consumption in many centuries, for the plainest of all reasons, because these articles may be imported from Amsterdam, or even from Petersburg and Archangel, cheaper than they can be raised at home. America will therefore be for ages a market for these articles of the Baltic trade.\nNor is there more solidity in another supposition, propagated by the English to prevent other nations from pursuing their true interests, that the colonies of other nations will follow the example of the United States. Those powers, who have as large possessions as any beyond seas, have already declared against England, apprehending no such consequences. Indeed there is no probability of any other power of Europe following the example of England, in attempting to change the whole system of the government of colonies, and reducing them by oppression to the necessity of governing themselves: and without such manifest injustice and cruelty on the part of the metropolis, there is no danger of colonies attempting innovations. Established governments are founded deep in the hearts, the passions, the imaginations and understanding of the people; and without some violent change from without, to alter the temper and character of the whole people, it is not in human nature to exchange safety for danger, and certain happiness for precarious benefits. It is submitted to the consideration of your High Mightinesses, whether the system of the United States, which was minutely considered and discussed, and unanimously agreed on in Congress in the year 1776, in planning the treaty they proposed to France, to form equitable commercial treaties with all the maritime powers of Europe, without being governed or monopolized by any: a system which was afterwards approved by the king, and made the foundation of the treaties with his Majesty: a system to which the United States have hitherto constantly adhered, and from which they never will depart, unless compelled by some powers declaring against them, which is not expected, is not the only means of preventing this growing country from being an object of everlasting jealousies, rivalries and wars among the nations. If this idea is just, it follows, that it is the interest of every State in Europe to acknowledge American independency immediately. If such benevolent policy should be adopted, the new world will be a proportional blessing to every part of the old.\nThe subscriber has the further honor of informing your H. M. that the U. States of America, in Congress assembled, impressed with an high sense of the wisdom and magnanimity of your H.

    "content": "Sunday Eve. [April?, 1772]\nDear Sir:\nI have this day repeated in the most accurate manner I was able, my experiment with the Bladder gilded with leaf brass, and suspended on an arm of wood turning freely on a needles point. The following is the result of many trials. After giving the bladder a strong spark from the knob of a positively charged bottle; on presenting towards it a smooth round ball 2 Inches diameter, I found it would come towards it, at upwards of two inches distance, and whenwithin an inchwould throw off its electricity in a full strong spark, (in short as the air was dry, and the silk perfectly good and smooth by which it was suspended,)as great an oneas it had received from the bottle. After giving the spark as before; upon presenting a fine point towards it, it never acceeded to the point in the least, and when it was pushed nearly into contact, (unless it was done very hastily,) no sensible quantity remained in it. I should have observed that if the ball was presented towards the bladder, even if it was swinging in a contrary direction, it would come back and meet it, throwing its electricity upon it at an inch distance as above described.\nI suppose Mr. Nairne told you of our ill success, with his batteries, and their having little or no effect on my Electrometer. To prove the goodness ofthatmeasure, I have this day tried it with your battery setting it upon the prime conductor. I gave the battery 100 turns of my small machine before the index began to move, but it then went on very regularly till it goot ⅒ Inch aboveright angles, when it made an effort to discharge itself but ended in hissing. At this instant I saw every one of the wooden tops to the bottles beset with loose filaments, I counted 7 upon one of them, and I believe in the whole there might be some 100. Think Sir how this must dissipate that atmosphere which ought to have been confined to the index, and to have regulated its action. On discharging it, the report was amazing, and much melted all the connecting wires. I saw plainly Mr. Nairnes error, and had he been advised by me, he might have prevented it. I have however put him in an easy, and simple way to correct it.\nI do still aver, that if the apparatus be properly made,every thing dry, and well connected, the Electrometer is a just and accurate measurer, a satisfactory and most useful instrument, as with this you are always sure of your force before the discharge.\nSome friends of mine being strongly of opinion that the matter of light, and the Electric matter are the same thing, I made an experiment to determine the question (not for my own) but for their satisfaction. I insulated my rubber and collecting the Solar Rays in a burning glass brought it so as to let the rubber be in the focus, I burnt my rubber, (which is wood,) several times, but without producing any Electricity. Believe me Dear Sir to be with real regard yours\nWHenly"

A Prince who even at his tender years afforded such flattering expectations of future virtues and greatness snatched from the hopes of your Royal Highness and his country, is justly considered as an irreparable bereavement, and claims our sincere sympathy. Whilst under this mournful visitation we mingle our affliction with that of your Royal Family, and the Portuguese nation, we pray you to be assured of the continuance of those friendly sentiments, founded on mutual interest, which have hitherto united the two nations in an harmonious and beneficial intercourse. May the Lord have you, Great and Good Friend, in his most holy keeping.\nWritten at the City of Washington on this 12th. day of October in the Year of Our Lord One thousand eight hundred & one.\nYour Good Friend.\nTh: Jefferson."
